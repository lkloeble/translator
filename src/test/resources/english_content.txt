nkjv_genesis_chapter1A=>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1B=>The earth was without form@N, and void; and darkness was on the face@1 of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters@N.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1C=>Then God said, Let there be light; and there was light.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1D=>And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1E=>God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1F=>Then God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters@N, and let it divide the waters@N from the waters@N."
nkjv_genesis_chapter1G=>Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters@N which were under the firmament from the waters@N which were above the firmament; and it was so.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1H=>And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1I=>Then God said, Let the waters@N under the heavens be gathered together into one place@N, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1J=>And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters@N He called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1K=>Then God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth; and it was so.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1L=>And the earth brought forth grass, the herb that yields seed according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1M=>So the evening and the morning were the third day.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1N=>Then God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years;
nkjv_genesis_chapter1O=>and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth; and it was so.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1P=>Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1Q=>God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth,
nkjv_genesis_chapter1R=>and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1S=>So the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1T=>Then God said, Let the waters@N abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1U=>So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters@N abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1V=>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters@N in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1W=>So the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1X=>Then God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according to its kind; and it was so.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1Y=>And God made the beast of the earth according to its kind, cattle according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1Z=>Then God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1AA=>So God created man in His own@P image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1BB=>Then God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1CC=>And God said, See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1DD=>Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food; and it was so.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1EE=>Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2A=>Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2B=>And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2C=>Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2D=>This is the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,
nkjv_genesis_chapter2E=>before any plant@N of the field was in the earth and before any herb of the field had grown. For the Lord God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to till@V the ground;
nkjv_genesis_chapter2F=>but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2G=>And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2H=>The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2I=>And out of the ground the Lord God made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2J=>Now a river went out of Eden to water@V the garden, and from there it parted and became four riverheads.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2K=>The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which skirts the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2L=>And the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and the onyx stone are there.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2M=>The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one which goes around the whole land of Cush.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2N=>The name of the third river is Hiddekel; it is the one which goes toward the east of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2O=>Then the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2P=>And the Lord God commanded the man, saying : Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat;
nkjv_genesis_chapter2Q=>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2R=>And the Lord God said, It is not good that man should be alone; I will@V make him a helper comparable to him.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2S=>Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2T=>So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2U=>And the Lord God caused a deep sleep@N to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place@N.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2V=>Then the rib which the Lord God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2W=>And Adam said : This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2X=>Therefore a man shall leave@V his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2Y=>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3A=>Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, Has God indeed said : You shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
nkjv_genesis_chapter3B=>And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden
nkjv_genesis_chapter3C=>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3D=>Then the serpent said to the woman, You will@V not surely die.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3E=>For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will@V be opened, and you will@V be like God, knowing good and evil.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3F=>So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3G=>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves@N together and made themselves coverings.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3H=>And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3I=>Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, Where are you ?
nkjv_genesis_chapter3J=>So he said, I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3K=>And He said, Who told you that you were naked ? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat ?
nkjv_genesis_chapter3L=>Then the man said, The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3M=>And the Lord God said to the woman, What is this you have done ? The woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3N=>So the Lord God said to the serpent: Because you have done this, You are cursed more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your belly you shall go, And you shall eat dust All the days of your life.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3O=>And I will@V put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3P=>To the woman He said: I will@V greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; In pain you shall bring forth children; Your desire@N shall be for your husband, And he shall rule over you.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3Q=>Then to Adam He said, Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying : You shall not eat of it : Cursed is the ground for your sake; In toil you shall eat of it All the days of your life.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3R=>Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, And you shall eat the herb of the field.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3S=>In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread Till you return to the ground, For out of it you were taken; For dust you are, And to dust you shall return.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3T=>And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3U=>Also for Adam and his wife the Lord God made tunics of skin, and clothed them.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3V=>Then the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like@P one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"
nkjv_genesis_chapter3W=>therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3X=>So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4A=>Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, " I have acquired a man from the Lord. "
nkjv_genesis_chapter4B=>Then she bore again, this time his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4C=>And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to the Lord.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4D=>Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord respected Abel and his offering,
nkjv_genesis_chapter4E=>but He did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4F=>So the Lord said to Cain, " Why are you angry ? And why has your countenance fallen ?
nkjv_genesis_chapter4G=>If you do well, will you not be accepted ? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door. And its desire@N is for you, but you should rule over it."
nkjv_genesis_chapter4H=>Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4I=>Then the Lord said to Cain, " Where is Abel your brother ? " He said, " I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper ? "
nkjv_genesis_chapter4J=>And He said, " What have you done ? The voice of your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4K=>So now you are cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4L=>When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth."
nkjv_genesis_chapter4M=>And Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is greater than I can bear@1 !
nkjv_genesis_chapter4N=>Surely You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; I shall be hidden from Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, and it will happen that anyone who finds me will kill me."
nkjv_genesis_chapter4O=>And the Lord said to him, "Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold." And the Lord set a mark on Cain, lest anyone finding him should kill him.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4P=>Then Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4Q=>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4R=>To Enoch was born |Irad|; and |Irad| begot |Mehujael|, and |Mehujael| begot |Methushael|, and |Methushael| begot |Lamech|.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4S=>Then Lamech took for himself two wives : the name of one was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4T=>And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4U=>His brother's name was Jubal. He was the father of all those who play the harp and flute.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4V=>And as for Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every craftsman in bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was |Naamah|.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4W=>Then Lamech said to his wives: "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, listen to my speech ! For I have killed a man for wounding me, Even a young man for hurting me.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4X=>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold."
nkjv_genesis_chapter4Y=>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, "For God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel, whom Cain killed."
nkjv_genesis_chapter4Z=>And as for Seth, to him also a son was born; and he named him |Enosh|. Then men began to call on the name of the Lord.
lightfoot_page1A=>during the middle ages, the Talmud was the exclusive property of the jews. Tragically it was not even allowed to be their property, for the persecutions of the jewish heretics (and later of the protestant heretics too) extended also to their sacred books@N.
lightfoot_page1B=>As a consequence, very few manuscripts of the babylonian and jerusalem talmuds survive. With the revival of hebrew and the study of hebrew bible that came with the reformation, there came also an interest in other jewish works. One of the fine fruits of this movement was the work of the hebraist john lightfoot (1602 - 1675)
lightfoot_page1C=>Lightfoot was one of many earnest christian scholars of his time. Master of St Catherine Hall@1, Cambridge, he possessed the classical learning@N of those days. He was at home in Latin and Greek, and he was a master not only of classical hebrew, but also of mishnaic hebrew and the aramaic of the Talmud.
lightfoot_page1D=>We are reminded of his elder contemporary |Lancelot| |Andrewes|, one of the translators of the King James Version of the Bible, who composed prayers for himself in hebrew !
lightfoot_page1E=>Aside from lightfoot's scholarly writings and productive teaching@N, he took part in westminster assembly, which sat from 1643 to 1649. He belonged to the erastian party, favoring an established church, and this is reflected in the present work in his letter of thanks to |Gilbert|, who lightfoot says is, by divine providence, archbishop of |canterbury|, primate of all england.
lightfoot_page2A=>Lightfoot lived in troubled times. Born in the last days of Queen Elizabeth, he was a boy when the King James Version was published. He sat in the Westminster Assembly while the |Long| parliament beheaded King Charles |I|, then somehow survived the restoration under Charles |II|, all the while maintaining a real Christian testimony and making an important scholarly contribution to scripture study.
lightfoot_page2B=>From his commentary one would hardly guess at the turbulent times in which he lived.
lightfoot_page2C=>One point is of interest. In the days of |Oliver| |Cromwell|, when Lightfoot was at the height of his powers, the jews were allowed again in England after 250 years of proscription.
lightfoot_page2D=>Lightfoot's commentary should be compared with the |Kommentar| |zum| |neuen| |testament| by |Strack| and |Billerbeck|. This extensive german commentary is the only other work that attempts fully to use the Talmud and related jewish material in elucidating the New Testament.
lightfoot_page2E=>|Strack|-|Billerbeck| is more extensive than lightfoot, includes the whole new testament, and is more recent.
lightfoot_page2F=>But the Talmud has not changed since lightfoot's day, though obviously Talmud studies have advanced.
lightfoot_page2G=>Lightfoot's comment on the new Testament text and his use of the Talmud reflect his theologically conservative stance, however, and of course Lightfoot is in English.
lightfoot_page2H=>(Lightfoot's commentary, which was originally published between 1658 and 1674, was written in latin. It was translated in english and published in four volumes in 1859. The title of this edition was |horae| |hebraicae| |et| |talmudicae| : hebrew and talmudical exercitations... this is the edition here being reprinted)
lightfoot_page2I=>an interesting comparison of the two works appears in their comments on luke 3:23 : Jesus was "(as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli ". Lightfoot's view of Luke's meaning@N is that Jesus was the legal son of Joseph but the natural son (grandson) of Heli through Mary;
lightfoot_page2J=>Jesus was then the son (great grandson) of Matthat and so on to Seth, and Jesus was thus the son of Adam and the Son of God (see vol 3 p 54).
lightfoot_page3A=>This view is not widely adopted today, the tendency being to leave@V Joseph with two fathers, or more commonly to see a contradiction between the genealogies of Matthew and Luke.
lightfoot_page3B=>But Lightfoot's data as to such a series in Genesis 36:2 have not been answered.
lightfoot_page3C=>Note that in the previous verse Luke quotes the voice at Jesus Baptism that said Jesus was the son of God.
lightfoot_page3D=>Also we know from Romans 1:3 that Paul, Luke's mentor, was concerned with Jesus physical ancestry.
lightfoot_page3E=>Lightfoot supports this view with a citation from the tractate Hagigah of the Jerusalem Talmud.
lightfoot_page3F=>According to this passage someone in his sleep saw " Mary the daughter of Heli (|'ly|) amongst the shades (|bslym|) " * in torment, hanging by her breast and with the great bar of hell's gate hanging at her ear.
lightfoot_page3G=>The reference to Mary as daughter of Heli is, of course, most important.
lightfoot_page3H=>Since the Jerusalem Talmud has not been translated into english, and has been only partly into german, we can compare Lightfoot's translation only with the french : |il| |voyait| |Miriam| |la| |fille| |d'Ali|-|Becalim|.
lightfoot_page3I=>But |Strack|-|Billerbeck| rejects the translation " Mary the daughter of Heli " and instead renders the consonants |ly| |bslym| " onion leaves@N " (|Zwiebelblatt|)..
lightfoot_page3J=>It does not explain, however, why Mary would be hanging by her breasts in an onion patch !.
lightfoot_page3K=>This seems almost a desperate effort to avoid a reference to Mary as daughter of Heli..
lightfoot_page3L=>These suggestions of Lightfoot appear to be the only one that make sense, which evidently means@V that Jewish tradition – either from original knowledge or from reading@N the New Testament – considered Mary the Daughter of Heli. |**|.
lightfoot_page3M=>* : it may be possible to improve on Lightfoot's translation of |bslym| (aramaic of |besalim|) as " amongst the shades ". The first part of this compound word is the preposition |beth| " among " or " in ".
lightfoot_page3N=>Lightfoot apparently takes the second part to be the masculine plural of the hebrew |sal| " shadow " or " shade@1 ".
lightfoot_page3O=>But |sal| usually refers to a shadow that protects. The second part of |bslym| might instead be |slm|, " deep gloom ", a root@N attested in arabic and akkadian ;
lightfoot_page3P=>thus some translate |salmaweth|, " shadow of death " as |salmuth|, " deep gloom ". Mary, then, was in the deep darkness.
lightfoot_page3Q=>|**| tradition also said that Mary is suffering in hell because of her boastfulness.
lightfoot_page3R=>This seems a very light@1 cause for such severe punishment, unless she was thought to have boasted that she was, as Christian claimed, the Mother of God.
lightfoot_page4A=>This is a good example of a novel approach in interpretation by lightfoot that has been largely neglected by many and rejected by some@1 without an adequate alternative
lightfoot_page4B=>Lightfoot fortunately gives us in crucial places@N the hebrew or aramaics phrases on which he bases his views
lightfoot_page4C=>This is important because it is sometimes a chore to check his quotations
lightfoot_page4D=>It may be mentioned that his occasional enigmatic footnotes refering to " english |folio| edition " or " |leusden| edition " refer to earlier editions of his own@P writings in english or latin
lightfoot_page4E=>These are not easily available, but it is not essential to refer to them
lightfoot_page4F=>He worked in a day when there was no translation of either the babylonian or the jerusalem talmud
lightfoot_page4G=>The babylonian talmud has now been translated in english and german. An older english edition by |rodkinson| * is said to be unsatisfactory and in any case is divided into chapters and sections rather than by folio and page, the designation that lightfoot and most others use
lightfoot_page4H=>Now being published is the great soncino talmud, edited by |epstein| |**|, with hebrew aramaic and english on facing pages and divided by folio and page
lightfoot_page4I=>It is not yet complete, but the parts that have appeared can be handily used to follow up lightfoot's references
lightfoot_page4J=>Other parts can be easily consulted in the earlier soncino english translation |***|, which does not include the hebrew aramaic text, but which is complete
lightfoot_page4K=>The Jerusalem talmud, as previously remarked, has not been rendered into english, which is odd considering the significance of this work
lightfoot_page4L=>It has been translated into french, but unfortunately the french edition is also divided into chapters and verses, making it difficult to locate lightfoot's references
lightfoot_page4M=>* : Michael |L| |Rodkinson| |ed| New Edition of the Babylonian Talmud, 20 |vols| in 10 (|New||York| : New Talmud 1896 1903). For these editions see |Hermann| |L| |Strack|

lightfoot_page5A=>There are probably two dangers in talmud study, the one of underemphasis, the other of exaggeration.
lightfoot_page5B=>The talmud is a compilation of jewish tradition from early medieval times.
lightfoot_page5C=>The unanswered and likely unanswerable question is how accurately this tradition reflects early times.
lightfoot_page5D=>Doubtless a part this tradition is valid. The question is, which part ?
lightfoot_page5E=>In form the talmud is an interpretation and application of the mishna, and the mishna of the pentateuch.
lightfoot_page5F=>After the close of the old testament canon, when jews were conscious that prophecy had ceased *, leaders of jewish thought were faced with questions of ethics and practice that demanded new applications of the law.
lightfoot_page5G=>These precedents were discussed by generations of scholars called tannaim, and their deliberations became a body of traditional opinion.
lightfoot_page5H=>In about |A|. |D|. 200 these oral traditions were written down in the mishna in six divisions (called " orders@N ") comprising sixty three chapters (tractates).
lightfoot_page5I=>These were written in a late dialect of hebrew called mishnaic hebrew.
lightfoot_page5J=>As time went on, more discussion gave rise to more precedents, and these discussion of later generations of scholars, called amoraïm, were written down in aramaic.
lightfoot_page5K=>These aramaic chapters (gemara) were appended to the paragraphs of the mishna, sp the talmud has a paragraph of hebrew followed by aramaic commentary.
lightfoot_page5L=>It was written down A.D. 500 in two recensions : the palestinian or jerusalem talmud, and the longer and more widely used babylonian talmud.
lightfoot_page5M=>It will@V be observed that the jews did not begin to write down these traditions until A.D. 200, and the Talmud was not completed until 500.
lightfoot_page5N=>The talmudic manuscripts that survived the medieval burnings of jewish books are few and come from the middle ages.
lightfoot_page5O=>Therefore they should be used with some caution in interpreting the New Testament.
lightfoot_page5P=>The New Testament histories were written down within one lifetime of the death of Christ – most of them within about forty years.

leviathan_prefaceA=>Nature (the art whereby God hath made and governs the world) is by the art of man, as in many other things, so in this also imitated, that it can make an Artificial Animal.
leviathan_prefaceB=>For seeing life is but a motion of Limbs, the begining whereof is in some principall part@N within; why may we not say, that all Automata (Engines that move themselves by springs@1 and wheeles as doth a watch@1) have an artificiall life ?
leviathan_prefaceC=>For what is the Heart, but a Spring@1; and the Nerves, but so many Strings; and the Joynts, but so many Wheeles, giving motion to the whole Body, such as was intended by the Artificer ?
leviathan_prefaceD=>Art goes yet further, imitating that Rationall and most excellent worke of Nature, Man.
leviathan_prefaceE=>For by Art is created that great LEVIATHAN called a COMMON-WEALTH, or STATE, (in latine |CIVITAS|) which is but an Artificiall Man;
leviathan_prefaceF=>though of greater stature and strength than the Naturall, for whose protection and defence it was intended;
leviathan_prefaceG=>and in which, the Soveraignty is an Artificiall Soul, as giving life and motion to the whole body;
leviathan_prefaceH=>The Magistrates, and other Officers of Judicature and Execution, artificiall Joynts; Reward and Punishment (by which fastned to the seat of the Soveraignty, every joynt and member is moved to performe his duty) are the Nerves, that do the same in the Body Naturall;
leviathan_prefaceI=>The Wealth and Riches of all the particular members, are the Strength; |Salus| |Populi| (the Peoples@1 Safety) its Businesse;
leviathan_prefaceJ=>Counsellors, by whom all things needfull for it to know, are suggested unto it, are the Memory; Equity and Lawes, an artificiall Reason and Will;
leviathan_prefaceK=>Concord, Health; Sedition, Sicknesse; and Civill War, Death.
leviathan_prefaceL=>Lastly, the Pacts and Covenants, by which the parts of this Body |Politique| were at first made, set together, and united, resemble that |Fiat|, or the Let Us Make Man, pronounced by God in the Creation.
leviathan_prefaceM=>To describe the Nature of this Artificiall man, I will consider First the Matter thereof, and the Artificer; both which is Man.
leviathan_prefaceN=>Secondly, How, and by what Covenants it is made; what are the Rights and just Power or Authority of a Soveraigne; and what it is that Preserveth and Dissolveth it.
leviathan_prefaceO=>Thirdly, what is a Christian Common-Wealth.
leviathan_prefaceP=>Lastly, what is the Kingdome of Darkness.
leviathan_prefaceQ=>Concerning the first, there is a saying much usurped@1 of late, That Wisedome is acquired, not by reading@N of Books@N, but of Men. Consequently whereunto, those persons, that for the most part can give no other proof of being wise, take great delight to shew what they think they have read in men, by uncharitable censures of one another behind their backs.
leviathan_prefaceR=>But there is another saying not of late understood, by which they might learn truly to read one another, if they would take the pains; and that is, |Nosce| |Te| |ipsum|, Read Thy Self:
leviathan_prefaceS=>which was not meant, as it is now used, to countenance, either the barbarous state of men in power, towards their inferiors;
leviathan_prefaceT=>or to encourage men of low degree, to a sawcie behaviour towards their betters; But to teach us, that for the similitude of the thoughts, and Passions of one man, to the thoughts, and Passions of another, whosoever looketh into himselfe, and considereth what he doth, when he does Think, Opine, Reason, Hope@N, Feare, etc, and upon what grounds;
leviathan_prefaceU=>he shall thereby read and know, what are the thoughts, and Passions of all other men, upon the like occasions.
leviathan_prefaceV1=>I say the similitude of Passions, which are the same in all men, Desire, Feare, Hope, etc;
leviathan_prefaceV2=>not the similitude or The Objects of the Passions, which are the things Desired, Feared, Hoped, etc:
leviathan_prefaceW1=>for these the constitution individuall, and particular education do so vary, and they are so easie to be kept from our knowledge,
leviathan_prefaceW2=>that the characters of mans heart, blotted and confounded as they are, with dissembling, lying, counterfeiting, and erroneous doctrines, are legible onely to him that searcheth hearts.
leviathan_prefaceX=>And though by mens actions wee do discover their designee sometimes; yet to do it without comparing them with our own, and distinguishing all circumstances, by which the case may come to be altered, is to decypher without a key, and be for the most part deceived, by too much trust, or by too much diffidence; as he that reads, is himselfe a good or evill man.
leviathan_prefaceY=>But let one man read another by his actions never so perfectly, it serves him onely with his acquaintance, which are but few. He that is to govern a whole Nation, must read in himselfe, not this, or that particular man; but Man-kind;
leviathan_prefaceZ=>which though it be hard to do, harder than to learn any Language, or Science;
leviathan_prefaceAA=>yet, when I shall have set down my own reading orderly, and perspicuously, the pains left another, will be onely to consider, if he also find not the same in himselfe.
leviathan_prefaceBB=>For this kind of Doctrine, admitteth no other Demonstration.

lightfoot_ch1A=>The division of the land
lightfoot_ch1B=>The jewish writers divide the whole world into ארצ ישראל "the land of Israel" and חוצה לארצ "without the land" : that is, the countries of heathen.
lightfoot_ch1C=>Both which phrases the book of the gospel owns : "the land of israel", Matt. II 20 and it calls the heathens, |τους| |εξω|, " those that are without " |I| Cor V 13, |I| Tm 3:7, and sometimes the unbelieving jews themselves, as Mark 4:2.
lightfoot_ch1D=>They distinguish all the people of the world into |ישראל| "israelites" and |אומות| |העולם| "the nations of the world".
lightfoot_ch1E=>The book@N of the gospel own that phrase also, Mt 6:32 |παντα| |ταυτα| |τα| |εθνη| |επιζητει| "after all these things, do the gentiles (or nations) seek : " which is in luke 12:30 is |εθνη| |του| |κοσμου| "the nations of the world".
lightfoot_ch1F=>Hence the word "world" is most commonly used for the gentiles ; John 3:16-17, 1 Jn 2:2, etc.
lightfoot_ch1G=>Somewhere a distinction is made into |ארצ| "the land [ of israel ] ", and מדינת הים "the region of the sea" וכל חל קרי מדינת הים בר מבבל "and every foreign region is called the region of the sea, except Babylon " - they are the words of rabbi Solomon *.
lightfoot_ch1H=>Which, nevertheless, fall under the censure of R. Nissim ** : "it is something hard (saith he) to reckon every country, which is out of the land, to be the region of the sea : for then, under that name, would be included all the neighbouring places, and which are, as it were, swallowed up by the land.
lightfoot_ch1I=>They say, therefore, that the more remote places are called מדינת הים " The region of the sea " ?
lightfoot_ch1J=>But neither@1 does this please me : for there is no need of so great distance, to make any place to be called, " the region of the sea ".
lightfoot_ch1K=>But it is spoken in relation to the western coast of the land of Israel ;
lightfoot_ch1L=>on which side there are no [ heathen ] cities near, and swallowed up by the land.
lightfoot_ch1M=>But the sea sets the bound ; but it doth not set the bounds@N on other sides, etc.
lightfoot_ch1N=>The sense, therefore, of R. Solomon, when he saith "  that every region, without the land, is the region of the sea " comes to this, - that every region, which is like to that region, is so called.
lightfoot_ch1O=>* R. Sol in Gittin, cap I
lightfoot_ch1P=>** R. Nissim ibid
lightfoot_ch1Q=>Heathen cities were on that western coast ; but seeing they lay within the ancient bounds@N of the land, namely, the " lip@1 of the mediterranean sea " –
lightfoot_ch1R=>they could not so properly be said to be " without the land ", as those which were altogether " without the limits@N ".
lightfoot_ch1S=>Those cities and that country, therefore, are called by a peculiar title, מדינת הים that is the  " coast or country by the mediterranean sea ".
lightfoot_ch1T=>Which title all other cities of the like condition underwent also, wheresoever seated within the bounds@N of the land.
lightfoot_ch1U=>Examples will not be wanting as we go along.
lightfoot_ch1V=>They commonly define the " land of Israel " under a double notion : to wit, that (hebrew) " which they possessed, who went up out of egypt " and that (hebrew) " which they possessed, who went up out of babylon ".
lightfoot_ch1W=>This was, in very many places, circumscribed within narrower limits@N than that, not only by reason Samaria was rejected and shut out, but also, because certain portions were cut off (and they neither a few nor small), which became the possessions of those, that went up out of Egypt ;
lightfoot_ch1X=>but, under the second temple, had passed into the possession of the heathen.
lightfoot_ch1Y=>Now they were, upon this account, the more exact in observing their bounds@N, distinguishing this land by known bounds@N, both from all others, and, in some places, as it were, from himself ;
lightfoot_ch1Z=>because they decreed, that very many mysteries of their religion were to be handled nowhere but within these limits@N.
lightfoot_ch1AA=>For (|e|) besides the rites of that dispensation, which the holy scriptures doth openly and evidently fix to that land, such as sacrifices, passovers, the priesthood (|f|), and other appointments of that nature (which are commonly, and not improperly, called (hebrew) ( " Statutes appendant to that land "), very many others also are circumscribed within the same borders by the fathers of the traditions. " the land of Israel (say they (|g|)), above all other lands, is sanctified by ten holinesses. And what is the holiness of it ? Out of it they bring the sheaf, and the first-fruits, and the two loaves. And they do not so out of any other land ".
lightfoot_ch1BB=>"The law of beheading the cow doth not take place anywhere, but in the land of Israel, and beyond Jordan (|h|) ".
lightfoot_ch1CC=>"they do not appoint of determine concerning the new moons, nor do they intercalate the year any where but in the land of Israel : as it is said, the law shall go forth out of Sion (|i|)".
lightfoot_ch1DD=>"They do not prefer the eldership out of the land of Israel : no, not although they that do prefer, have themselves been preferred within the land (|j|)"
lightfoot_ch1EE=>And that I heap not together more, they do, in a manner, circumscribe the Holy Spirit himself within the limits@N of that land.
lightfoot_ch1FF=>For "Shekhina (say they (|k|)) dwells not upon any out of the land". Compare Act |X|:45.
lightfoot_ch1GG=>The land which the Jews, that came up out of Babylon, possess, they divide after this manner :
lightfoot_ch1HH=>"there (|l|) are three lands (or countries), (hebrew), Judea, the land beyond Jordan, and Galilee; and each of those have three countries : " – those we shall take notice of in their places. To this received division our Saviour hath respect, when sending his disciples to preach to the "lost sheep of Israel" he excludes Samaria, Matt |X|:5; which according to the condition of the nation, was not merely heathen, nor was it truly Israel.
lightfoot_ch1II=>It was not heathen; for (|m|) (hebrew) "the land of Samaria is reckoned clean, and the gathering together of its waters clean, and its dwelling clean, and its paths clean" which the jewish curiosity would by no means@N pronounce of a heathen land. But as to many other things, they made no difference between them and the gentiles.
lightfoot_ch1JJ=>The jewish doctors do, indeed, particularly apply that division of the three countries in the place alleged, to the tradition and canon concerning (hebrew) ; but yet they do everywhere retain the same, wheresoever they treat of the division of the land of Israel.
lightfoot_ch1KK=>What (hebrew) means, you may learn from the authors of the gloss@1 upon the place.
lightfoot_ch1LL=>Briefly it was this : in their seventh year they might eat of the fruit laid up in their storehouses, so long as some fruit of that kind hung upon the tree in that country : but when they could no more find them upon the trees, they were to cast out those which they had gathered, and laid up at home, and not to eat of them, as they did before.
lightfoot_ch2A=>The Talmudic Girdle of the land under the second temple, taken out of the Jerusalem |Sheviit|, fol 36.3 (hebrew) ibid col, 4
lightfoot_ch2B1=>What all these things mean@V, I cannot so much as conjecture; yea, nor can I scarce@1 conjecture, what the meaning@N is of some of them.
lightfoot_ch2B2=>Neither is there any |Oedipus| at hand, nor |Sphinx| herself, to explain and unriddle them. The talmudists are silent from making any comments here, nor have we the advantage of any other commentator.
lightfoot_ch2B3=>We must, therefore, act here according to the uncertain instruction of nods and winks; and that either by saying nothing, or by mere conjecture, since that the mind of the authors is neither altogether unknown, or it is wholly doubtful, whether it be known or no.
lightfoot_ch2B4=>Expect not, that I go from street to street to knock at all the gates of these places : it will be enough, if we can scrape out, in what regions these places lie, and are able to guess at what points of the heaven they are disposed.
lightfoot_ch2B5=>We will at present take in hand only the first and last clause of this place quoted; which may have some tendency towards entrance into our present business.
lightfoot_ch2B6=>The rest (if there be any we can attain unto) we shall handle in their proper places.
lightfoot_ch2C=>"These (say they) are the bounds of the land of Israel, which they possessed that came out of Babylon".
lightfoot_ch2D=>"The division, or part, of the walls of the tower |Sid|". Nor dare I confidently to assert, that this is spoken of the "tower of |Strato|" or "Caesarea"; nor yet do I know to what it may more fitly be applied. We observe in its place, that that tower is called by the talmudists,
lightfoot_ch2E=>"the tower of |Sir|" : which by how very little a point it differs from this word, and how very apt it is by want of care in writing to be confounded with it, the eye of any reader is witness.
lightfoot_ch2F=>It may happily confirm this conjecture, that the name |Aco|, so soon follows only coming between.
lightfoot_ch2G=>Concerning which we have nothing to say, if that, which we meet with in the writers of the Babylonian Talmud, may not have any place here.
lightfoot_ch2H=>They say [p] &c. "Go in the lowest way, below the mountains" and they will protect you from showers and rain. Hence, therefore, it may be supposed, that the word שינ" doth denote some way at the foot of some mountainous place, which was, as it were, the dividing line between the 'land of Israël ' and 'without the land'; perhaps at the foot of mount Carmel : but we do not assert it : we had rather profess silence and ignorance, than, by a light of conjecture, either to deceive others or be deceived ourselves.
lightfoot_ch2I=>These places, concerning which the talmudists here treat, are of a different condition from those, which were called
lightfoot_ch2J=>"the region of the sea". For those places were certain towns, here and there, on this sea-coast, and elsewhere; which were, indeed, inhabited by heathens, and so could not properly reckoned the ' land of Israël '; yet they were such, as between which, and the outmost bounds of the land, was again the land of Israël. But these places, which we are now handling, are those, which were the utmost bounds, and beyond which were no places at all, but what was reckoned the ' land of the heathen ' : the phoenicians, syrians, or other gentiles, possessing all that coast thence forward unto the shore of the mediterranean sea.
lightfoot_ch2K=>We cannot also pass by those things, that are said by the gemarists in the very same page, from whence the scheme before-mentioned is taken.
lightfoot_ch2L=>&c. "You see isles in the sea; and if a line were drawn from the mountains of |Amana| to the river of Egypt, - whatsoever it within the line, belongs to the land of Israel;
lightfoot_ch2M=>whatsoever is without the line, is without the land" after the same manner speaks the Targum of Jerusalem upon Num XXXIV: : "and their western bounds@N shall be the great sea, and the isle of it".
lightfoot_ch2N=>Isles ? What isles ? Let the authors of the maps well weigh these passages.
lightfoot_ch3A=>A great part of south Judea cut off under the second Temple. Jewish Idumea.
lightfoot_ch3B=>The Talmudic girdle ends, as you see in (hebrew) "|Kadesh|, |Barnea| and |Ascalon|".
lightfoot_ch3C=>Hence it cannot but be observed, that these two places are placed, as it were, in parallel;
lightfoot_ch3D=>and whatsoever space lies between |Ascalon| and the river of Egypt, is excluded, - to wit, fifty four miles.
lightfoot_ch3E=>And one might indeed, almost see some footsteps of that exclusion under the first Temple, in that very common expression, "from Dan even to |BeerSheva|".
lightfoot_ch3F=>This country, that was excluded, was something barren.
lightfoot_ch3G=>The Talmudist speak thus of it; "that tract@1, which lies in |gerariku| |[gerar]| is ill to dwell in.
lightfoot_ch3H=>How far ? to the river of Egypt". And Strabo thus; "the country , which follows gaza is barren, and sandy" etc.
lightfoot_ch3I=>It was anciently inhabited by the avites, - namely, from gaza to the river of Egypt.
lightfoot_ch3J=>"the |avim| dwelt in |hazerim|", Deut II 23. |Hazar| is a word of most frequent mention  in that southern land, "hazar-addar, hazar-gaddah, hazar-shua, hazar-susah", etc.
lightfoot_ch3K=>And it seems to denote some champaign plain and level, lying between the mountains. Hence the habitation of the avites is called '|hazerim|';
lightfoot_ch3L=>who are numbered with the philistines, but yet by themselves, Jos 13:3. – for see there, how the holy text promising to number five nations only, number six.
lightfoot_ch3M=>This excluded portion is passed into the name of Idumea.
lightfoot_ch3N=>Hence |Pliny| : "presently from the rising up of the lake |Sirbon|, begins Idumea and Palestine".
lightfoot_ch3O=>Nor that alone, but another very great part of Judea.
lightfoot_ch3P=>Hence the sea of Sodom, is said, by |Diodorus| |Siculus| to be [greek]  "about the middle of Idumea".
lightfoot_ch3Q=>And in Josephus, and the book@N of the Maccabees, we find very many places mentioned under the name of Idumea, which were almost in the very middle of Judea.
lightfoot_ch3R=>For example's sake [greek] "he came even to the |gadari| and the plains of Idumea, and |Azotus| and |Jamnia|".
lightfoot_ch3S=>And again [greek] etc. [greek] etc. [greek]
lightfoot_ch3T=>"and Judas and his brethren left not off fighting with the idumeans : but fell upon them everywhere.
lightfoot_ch3U=>And taking the city |Chebron|, etc. And the city |Marissa|, etc. And having come unto |Azotus|", etc. And more to this purpose may be read here and there.
lightfoot_ch3V=>So that distinction may be made, between Idumea the greater and the less.
lightfoot_ch3W=>Simon of Gerasa [greek] overran the towns along the mountainous country etc.
lightfoot_ch3X=>And he overran |Acrabatene|, and the parts as far as Idumea the Great".
lightfoot_ch3Y=>And there in mention of [greek] "Idumea, called the Upper".
lightfoot_ch3Z=>With these passages, compare Mark 3:8.
lightfoot_ch3AA=>Whilst the Jews were absent from their own country, enduring the seventy years bondage in Babylone –
lightfoot_ch3BB=>it is easy to be believed, that their ancient enemies, the Edomites, and that were so from the very first original of them,
lightfoot_ch3CC=>had invaded their possessions, as much as they could, and had fixed their roots@N in that country especially, which was nearest their own :
lightfoot_ch3DD=>but at length, by the powerful arms of the Maccabees, and the asmoneans, they were either rooted out, or constrained to embrace Judaism.
lightfoot_ch3EE=>So Josephus speaks of |Hyrcanus| [greek] etc. "|Hyrcanus| takes |Ador| and |Marissa|, cities of Idumea :
lightfoot_ch3FF=>and having subdued all the idumeans, suffered them to remain in the country, on condition they were willing to be circumcised, and to use the jewish laws.
lightfoot_ch3GG=>And they, out of a desire@N of their own country, underwent circumcision, and conformed to the same course of life with the Jews".
lightfoot_ch3HH=>Hence there became a mingled generation in that country between Jew and Edomite : and the name of the place was mingled also, and called both Idumea and Judea :
lightfoot_ch3II=>"And Palestine was divided into five countries – Idumea, Judea, Samaria, Galilee, and the country beyond Jordan"
lightfoot_ch4A=>The seven seas according to the talmudists, and the four rivers compassing the land.
lightfoot_ch4B=>Seven seas and four rivers compass the land of Israël.
lightfoot_ch4C=>1 [hebrew] The great sea, or the Mediterranean.
lightfoot_ch4D=>2 [hebrew] The sea of Tiberias.
lightfoot_ch4E=>3 [hebrew] The sea of Sodom.
lightfoot_ch4F=>4 [hebrew] the lake of |Sachomo|.
lightfoot_ch4G=>5 [hebrew] o. 6 [hebrew] o. 7 [hebrew] o.
lightfoot_ch4H=>These four last are otherwise writ in the Jerusalem Talmud : to wit, thus, 4 [hebrew] o .
lightfoot_ch4I=>5 [hebrew] o. 6 [hebrew] o. 7  [hebrew] . In the Babylonian Talmud thus : 4 [hebrew]  o .
lightfoot_ch4J=>5 [hebrew]  o. 6  [hebrew] o. 7 [hebrew] o.
lightfoot_ch4K=>The three first named among the seven are sufficiently known, and there is no doubt of the fourth :only the three names of it are not to be passed by.
lightfoot_ch4L=>4. 1    The |sibbichaean|. The word seems to be derived from [hebrew] a bush.
lightfoot_ch4M=>2. [hebrew], which seems to sound the same thing : for [hebrew]  thorns, among the targumists, are [hebrew];
lightfoot_ch4N=>because that lake, having no great depth, but very much dried in the summer time, was grown over with thorns and bushes.
lightfoot_ch4O=>3 [hebrew], from whence the common name |samochonitis|, the letter (|mem|) and (|beth|) being changed in [hebrew] and [hebrew].
lightfoot_ch4P=>5 [hebrew] perhaps the sandy sea. Which fits very well to the lake of |Sirbon|, joining the commentary of |Diodorus| |Siculus|.
lightfoot_ch4Q=>For he relates, that that lake; for the most part; is so covered with sand, that it hath often deceived and supplanted travelers, yea, whole armies, thinking it to be firm land.
lightfoot_ch4R=>6 [hebrew] We have nothing to say of this, besides this observation, that since it is called by the same gemarists [hebrew], the guttural (|'heth|) seems to be melted into (|yod|);
lightfoot_ch4S=>which is not unusual to the dialect of the nation, so to smooth and soften guttural letters. It is also called, by the Babylonians, [hebrew],
lightfoot_ch4T=>which, among the talmudists, does sometimes signify rushy or sedgy : but what the sea is, we know not.
lightfoot_ch4U=>However, we do not forget the |cendevian| lake : but whether that be to be numbered among our catalogue, we doubt upon this reason, because on the same coast lies the great sea.
lightfoot_ch4V=>7 [hebrew] "the sea of |Apamia|". The Jerusalem writers, in both places, when they speak of that sea, add these words [hebrew] etc.
lightfoot_ch4W=>The sea of |Apamia| is the same with the sea of |Chamatz| [hebrew] etc. "|Dicletinus| caused it to be made by rivers gathered together".
lightfoot_ch4X=>It was, therefore, of a later date. Concerning it, see the sixty-eight chapter.
lightfoot_ch4Y=>After these seas, mentioned by the talmudists, hear also no lean story of theirs concerning the fish :
lightfoot_ch4Z=>"R. |Chaninah| Bar |Abhu| said, seven hundred kinds of clean fish, and eight hundred kinds of clean locusts, and of birds an infinite number, travelled with Israel into Babylone, and returned when Israel returned, except the fish [hebrew].
lightfoot_ch4AA=>But how did the fish travel ?
lightfoot_ch4BB=>R. |Houna| bar Joseph saith, [hebrew] they travelled by the way of the deep, and by the deep they came back."
lightfoot_ch4CC=>Surely it requires a jewish invention (which is able to frame any thing out of any thing), to trace a way, either by any sea, or by any river, through which fish might swim out of Palestine into Babylon.
lightfoot_ch4DD=>By the same art they bring Jonah in the belly of the whale, out of the Phoenician sea, into the red sea.
lightfoot_ch4EE=>That, indeed, is somewhat hard, yet no be doubted of, what is said, 2 Ch 8:18, concerning Hiram sending ships to Solomon into the red sea.
lightfoot_ch4FF=>What ! ships to come from |Tyre| into the red sea ? Which way sailed they ?
lightfoot_ch4GG=>it is answered, he sent such |tyrian| ships, which had much and long traded before in the red sea, to accompany Solomon's fleet.
lightfoot_ch4HH=>To this belongs that, that it is said there likewise (and in 1 Ro 9:27), that "he sent seamen, that had knowledge of the sea;" that is, knowledge of that sea :
lightfoot_ch4II=>and they probably not such, who had never yet adventured themselves into the red sea, but had experience of it before, and were not ignorant of the Ophir voyage.
lightfoot_ch4JJ=>The four rivers for the compassing of the land (they say) 1 [hebrew] Jordan; that is sufficiently known.
lightfoot_ch4KK=>2 [hebrew] Jarmoch. In Pliny, 'Hieramax' : "Gaddara (saith he), Hieramax flowing before it". 3 [hebrew] Kirmion. 4 [hebrew] Pigah.
lightfoot_ch4LL=>Concerning which the Aruch : "kirmion is a river in the way to Damascus, and is the same with Amanah. Pigah is Pharphar.
lightfoot_ch4MM=>And Jarmoch is also a river in the way to Damascus."
lightfoot_ch4NN=>And the talmudists : "the waters of |Kirmion| and |Pigah| are not fit" (to sprinkle the unclean), "because they are muddy waters.
lightfoot_ch4OO=>The waters also of Jordan, and the waters of |Jarmoch|, are not fit, because they are mixed waters:"
lightfoot_ch4PP=>that is, as the gloss speaks, mixed with the waters of other rivers, which they receive within themselves.
lightfoot_ch4QQ=>To the seven seas, concerning which we have spoken, those things which are said by |Midras| |Tillim|, do refer :
lightfoot_ch4RR=>"I have created seven seas, said the Lord, but out of them all I have chosen none, but the sea of |Gennesaret|".
lightfoot_ch4SS=>And of the river of |Amanah|, of which the |Aruch| speaks, mention is made in the Targum upon Can 4/8 :
lightfoot_ch4TT=>"they that dwell upon the river |Amanah|, shall offer thee a gift" etc.


lightfoot_ch5A01=>The sea of Sodom [hebrew]
lightfoot_ch5A02=>The bounds of Judea, on both sides, are the sea; the western bound is the Mediterranean, --
lightfoot_ch5A03=>the eastern, the Dead sea, or the sea of Sodom. This the Jewish writers every where call [hebrew],
lightfoot_ch5A04=>which you may not so properly interpret here, "the salt sea," as "the bituminous sea."
lightfoot_ch5A05=>In which sense [hebrew] word for word, "Sodom's salt," but properly "Sodom's bitumen," doth very frequently occur among them.
lightfoot_ch5A06=>The use of it was in the holy incense. They mingled [hebrew] bitumen, [hebrew] the amber of Jordan,
lightfoot_ch5A07=>and hebrew [an herb known to few], with the spices that made that incense.
lightfoot_ch5A08=>greek "The lake |Asphaltitis| is distant from Jerusalem three hundred furlongs":
lightfoot_ch5A09=>-- about eight-and-thirty miles.
lightfoot_ch5A10=>greek "It is extended in length five hundred and eighty furlongs";
lightfoot_ch5A11=>seventy-two miles. -- greek  "In breadth a hundred and fifty furlongs"; eighteen miles.
lightfoot_ch5A12=>Pliny speaks thus of it: "In length it is more than a hundred miles: in its greatest breadth, it makes five and twenty,
lightfoot_ch5A13=>-- in its least, six." What agreement is there between these two? I suppose Josephus does not comprehend within his measure the tongue of the sea,
lightfoot_ch5A14=>of which mention is made, Joshua 15:2 -- and defines the breadth, as it was generally every where diffused.
lightfoot_ch5A15=>Concerning its distance from Jerusalem, |Solinus| also speaks: "In a long retreat from Jerusalem (saith he) a sad bay openeth itself;
lightfoot_ch5A16=>which that it was struck from heaven, the ground, black and dissolved into ashes, testifies.
lightfoot_ch5A17=>There were two towns there, one named Sodom, the other Gomorrha."
lightfoot_ch5A18=>But that distance was not directly southward, but by a very long declination eastward.
lightfoot_ch5A19=>The Talmudists devote "to the sea of Sodom," hebrew any thing, that is destined to rejection and cursing, and that by no means is to be used.
lightfoot_ch5A20=>hebrew "Let him devote the use of such a thing to the bituminous sea."
lightfoot_ch5A21=>"Let the price of an oblation for sin, the owner whereof is dead, depart hebrew into the salt sea."
lightfoot_ch5A22=>hebrew "The proselyte |Aquila| divided the inheritance with his brother a Gentile, and devoted the use and benefit of it to the salt sea.
lightfoot_ch5A23=>Of three doctors one saith, That he devoted the moneys of idolatry into the salt sea."
lightfoot_ch5A24=>Hence is that allusion, Revelation 20:14, "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire."
lightfoot_ch5A25=>It doth not please me, that Sodom, in the maps, is placed in the northern bounds@N of the Asphaltites;
lightfoot_ch5A26=>when it seems rather to be placed in the southern extremity of it. For,
lightfoot_ch5A27=>|I|. The bounds of the land are thus defined by Moses, Genesis 10:19: "The borders of the Canaanites were from Sidon" (on the north)
lightfoot_ch5A28=>"unto Gaza" (on the south), "as thou |goest| forward, or until thou |comest| to Sodom."
lightfoot_ch5A29=>Are not the bounds here bent from Gaza to the farthest term opposite to it on the east?
lightfoot_ch5A30=>II. Josephus, in the description of the Asphaltites, which we quoted a little above, hath these words:
lightfoot_ch5A31=>"The length of it is five hundred and eighty furlongs : greek and it is stretched out as far as |Zoar| of |Arabia|."
lightfoot_ch5A32=>Note, that the farthest coast of the extension of it southward, is to |Zoar|.
lightfoot_ch5A33=>ut now |Zoar| was not far distant from Sodom, when Lot, with his company, got thither before the rising of the sun, Genesis 19:23.
lightfoot_ch5A34=>"It is written (say the Gemarists), ' The sun was risen upon the earth, when |Lot| entered into Sodom.' -- Now Sodom was four miles from |Zoar|."
lightfoot_ch5A35=>The maps show@V you |Zoar| and |Lot's| Cave in Judea, at the northern coast almost of the Asphaltites: -- by what authority, I do not apprehend.
lightfoot_ch5A36=>The Talmudists, indeed, do mention a certain |Zoar|, which they also call, "The City of Palms."
lightfoot_ch5A37=>-- "There is a story (say they) of some Levites, who travelled to |Zoar|, the city of palms:
lightfoot_ch5A38=>and one of them fell sick, whom they brought to an inn, and there he died."
lightfoot_ch5A39=>But I should sooner believe, that there were two |Zoars|, than I should believe,
lightfoot_ch5A40=>that the father of the Moabites were not conceived and born near |Zoar| of the land of Moab. See Isaiah 15:5.
lightfoot_ch5A41=>Concerning the age@1 of Sodom, when it perished, see the places in the margin@1, and weigh them well.

lightfoot_ch601=>"On the western shore" (of the Asphaltites) "dwell the Essenes;
lightfoot_ch602=>whom persons, guilty of any crimes, fly from on every side.
lightfoot_ch603=>A nation it is that lives alone, and of all other nations in the whole world, most to be admired;
lightfoot_ch604=>they are without any woman; all lust banished, |&c|.
lightfoot_ch605=>Below these, was the town |Engadda|, the next to Jerusalem for fruitfulness,
lightfoot_ch606=>and groves of palm-trees, now another burying-place.
lightfoot_ch607=>From thence stands |Massada|, a castle in a rock@1, and this castle not far from the Asphaltites."
lightfoot_ch608=>|Solinus|, Pliny's shadow, speaks the like things:
lightfoot_ch609=>"The Essenes possess the inner parts of Judea, which look to the west.
lightfoot_ch610=>The town |Engadda| lay beneath the Essenes; but it is now destroyed:
lightfoot_ch611=>but its glory for the famous groves, that are there, doth still endure:
lightfoot_ch612=>and in regard of its most lofty woods of palms, it hath received no disparagement either by age or war.
lightfoot_ch613=>The castle |Massada| is the bounds@N of Judea."
lightfoot_ch614=>We are looking for the places, not the men:
lightfoot_ch615=>-- we might otherwise begin the history of the Essenes from those words,
lightfoot_ch616=>Judges 1:16: "And the sons of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law,
lightfoot_ch617=>went out of the city of palms, with the sons of Judah, into the deserts of Judah."
lightfoot_ch618=>From these we suppose came the |Rechabites|, -- and from their stock, or example, the Essenes.
lightfoot_ch619=>Which if it be true, we make this an argument of the ill placing of |En|-|gedi| in the maps,
lightfoot_ch620=>being set too much towards the north, when it ought to have been placed towards the utmost southern coasts.
lightfoot_ch621=>If the Essenes were the same with the Kenites in seat and place, and the Kenites dwelt beyond |Arad| southward,
lightfoot_ch622=>or indeed even with |Arad|, which is asserted in the text alleged,
lightfoot_ch623=>-- and if below these were |En|-|gedi|, which is also asserted by the authors cited,
lightfoot_ch624=>-- certainly, then, the maps have laid it a long way distant from its own proper place, too much northward.
lightfoot_ch625=>View them, and think of these things. To which we also add this: --
lightfoot_ch626=>The southern borders of the land, Ezekiel 47:19 (the very same which are mentioned Numbers 34 and Joshua 15:2), are thus declared;
lightfoot_ch627=>"The southern coast southward from |Tamar| to the waters of |Meribah| in |Cadesh|," &c.
lightfoot_ch628=>But now |Tamar| and |En|-|gedi| are the same, 2 Chronicles 20:2. Nor have we any reason why we should seek another |Tamar| elsewhere.
lightfoot_ch629=>Certainly, the |Chaldee| paraphrast, and Rabbi |Sol|. |Jarchi|, and |Kimchi| following him, have rendered |Tamar|, in Ezekiel, |Jericho|.
lightfoot_ch630=>But upon what reason? For how, I beseech you, was it possible, that |Jericho| should be the bounds@N of the south land,
lightfoot_ch631=>when it was the utmost bounds@N of Judea northward?
lightfoot_ch632=>It was this, without all doubt, drove them to that version of the word, because |Jericho| is called the City of Palms,
lightfoot_ch633=>-- and |Tamar| hebrew signifies a palm; since |En|-|gedi| would not give place to |Jericho|, one inch in regard of the glory of palm-groves.
lightfoot_ch634=>Whether |Tadmor|, 1 Kings 9:18, be the same with this our |Tamar|,
lightfoot_ch635=>-- and whether |Tadmor| in the Talmudists be the same with that |Tadmor|,
lightfoot_ch636=>-- we leave to the reader to consider. We produce these few things concerning it, which are related by them
lightfoot_ch637=>-- for the sake of such consideration: --
lightfoot_ch638=>"They receive proselytes from those of |Cardya| and |Tadmor|. Rab. |Abhu|, in the name of R. |Jochanan|,
lightfoot_ch639=>saith, The tradition asserts, that the proselytes of |Tadmor| are fit to enter into the congregation."
lightfoot_ch640=>It was said a little before; "Haggai the prophet taught these three lessons:
lightfoot_ch641=>-- hebrew The rival of a daughter" (of a priest) "may be married by a priest.
lightfoot_ch642=>The Moabites and Ammonites ought to tithe the poor's tithe the seventh year.
lightfoot_ch643=>And the proselytes of |Tadmor| are fit to enter into the congregation."
lightfoot_ch644=>This story is recited, in the Jerusalem |Misna|: hebrew "Mary, of |Tadmor|,
lightfoot_ch645=>having part of the blood sprinkled upon her" (whereby she was to be purified), "heard in that very juncture of time,
lightfoot_ch646=>that her daughter was dead," |&c|. But the Babylonian calls her  hebrew "of |Tarmod|."
lightfoot_ch647=>-- "From the place |Tarmud|," saith the Gloss.
lightfoot_ch648=>-- The '|Tarmudeans|,' hebrew are said, by those of the Babylonian Talmud,
lightfoot_ch649=>to be certain poor people, who got themselves a livelihood by gathering up wood, and selling it.
lightfoot_ch650=>R. |Jochanan| said, "Blessed is he, who shall see the destruction of |Tadmor|:
lightfoot_ch651=>for she communicated in the destruction of the first and second Temple.
lightfoot_ch652=>In the destruction of the first, she brought eighty thousand archers: and so she did, in the destruction of the second."

lightfoot_ch701=>|I|. Of |Kadesh|, or |Rekam|, in the south part, there is no doubt.
lightfoot_ch702=>II. Of it, in the eastern part, there is this mention:
lightfoot_ch703=>"From |Rekam| to the east, and |Rekam| is as the east": that is, R. Nissim interpreting,
lightfoot_ch704=>"|Rekam| itself is reckoned for the east of the world" (that is, for the land of the heathen),
lightfoot_ch705=>"not for the land of Israel." Behold! a |Rekam|, or a |Kadesh|, also, on the east.
lightfoot_ch706=>But the maps have feigned to themselves another |Kadesh|, besides |Barnea|, and this eastern |Rekam|;
lightfoot_ch707=>whither, they think, the people of Israel came in the fortieth year of their travel, Numbers 20.
lightfoot_ch708=>These, we suppose, were some of the reasons, whereby the authors of them were drawn to it.
lightfoot_ch709=>I. Because |Kadesh|-|barnea| was in the desert of |Paran|, Numbers 12:16, 14:1.
lightfoot_ch710=>But the |Kadesh|, whither they came the fortieth year, was in the desert of |Zin|, Numbers 20:1.
lightfoot_ch711=>-- I answer, The searchers@1 of the land, departing from |Kadesh|-|barnea|, are said, also, to go out of the deserts of |Zin|, Number 13:21.
lightfoot_ch712=>|Paran| was the general name of that dreadful desert; |Zin| only one part of it.
lightfoot_ch713=>II. In |Kadesh|-|barnea| they encamped many days, Deuteronomy 1:46.
lightfoot_ch714=>But in that |Kadesh|, concerning which mention is made, Numbers 20, there was not provision sufficient,
lightfoot_ch715=>whereby they might be sustained one day.
lightfoot_ch716=>For they complain, that it was a place altogether destitute of seed, figs, vines, and pomegranates,
lightfoot_ch717=>Numbers 20:5: which they did not at all complain of, while they remained in |Kadesh|-|barnea|.
lightfoot_ch718=>-- I answer, Omitting, that wheresoever they encamped, they were fed by manna;
lightfoot_ch719=>the complaint arose among them, not so much of the place itself, as of the ill boding and prejudice, as I may so say, of the place;
lightfoot_ch720=>because, from the barrenness of this place, they prejudged of the like barrenness of that land, into which they were to enter,
lightfoot_ch721=>-- and the porch, as it were, of which, was |Kadesh|-|barnea|.
lightfoot_ch722=>When they came hither first, now thirty-eight years before,
lightfoot_ch723=>"Ye came to the mountain of the Amorites (saith Moses) which the Lord giveth you," Deuteronomy 1:20,21.
lightfoot_ch724=>" Is it so? " (think they with themselves) " Does the first entrance of the land of promise, promise no better ?
lightfoot_ch725=>There is little hope of the land itself, if the beginnings of it are such. It is convenient, therefore,
lightfoot_ch726=>that we send before us spies, who may bring us word, whether it is of so great account,
lightfoot_ch727=>that we should tire and hazard ourselves by going to that soil, whose first appearance is so horrid and desperate.
lightfoot_ch728=>-- And hence was that unhappy argument before their eyes, by the inducement of which the whole multitude,
lightfoot_ch729=>by so unanimous a vote, concluded and resolved@1 against the land. And since now, after so much time passed,
lightfoot_ch730=>they are come back to the same place, they think, distrust, and complain of the same things.
lightfoot_ch731=>|III|. In |Kadesh|-|barnea|, they had a supply of water; in |Kadesh|, whither they came the fortieth year,
lightfoot_ch732=>there was no water, Numbers 20, etc.
lightfoot_ch733=>-- I answer, They drank, when they first came to |Kadesh|-|barnea|, of the rock, which followed them (1 Cor 10:2),
lightfoot_ch734=>dried up, when they were now ready to enter into the land. If you ask, Why had those rivers that followed them, dried up,
lightfoot_ch735=>as soon as they came at |Kadesh|-|barnea|, which before had not dried up when they came thither;
lightfoot_ch736=>-- then I ask also, Why had they dried up, when they came to another |Kadesh| ?
lightfoot_ch737=>|IV.| Concerning the |Kadesh|, whither they came the last year of their travel,
lightfoot_ch738=>it is said, that the city was in the utmost bounds@N of the land of Edom :
lightfoot_ch739=>and therefore, they desire leave of the king to pass through the land of Edom, Numbers 20:16,17.
lightfoot_ch740=>-- I answer, Nothing at all hinders, but these things may be spoke of |Kadesh|-|barnea|,
lightfoot_ch741=>which lying contiguous to the mountain of the Amorites, that is, to mountainous Judea, showed so great an army an access,
lightfoot_ch742=>and promised it; only that access was winding, and very difficult to be passed.
lightfoot_ch743=>They desire, therefore, a more level way of the king of Edom, but obtain it not.
lightfoot_ch744=>V. Perhaps that which chiefly moved them, was this; that supposing one |Kadesh| only, to wit, |Barnea|,
lightfoot_ch745=>-- it will be scarce possible not to confound the encampings of Israel in the wilderness, and their movings from place to place.
lightfoot_ch746=>-- I answer, There will be the same easiness of ordering them,
lightfoot_ch747=>if you do but reduce the sixth and seventh verses of Deuteronomy 10, into a true sense,
lightfoot_ch748=>and into agreement with Numbers 33 from verses 31 to 41;
lightfoot_ch749=>which is not hard to do. But let these things suffice, for the present, to have spoke besides our scope.
lightfoot_ch750=>That that |Kadesh|, to which they came in the fortieth year (which is called |Meribah|, Numbers 20:13),
lightfoot_ch751=>is the same with |Kadesh|-|barnea|, is clear enough from hence,
lightfoot_ch752=>-- that |Meribah| in |Kadesh| is assigned for the southern border of the land, Ezekiel 47:19;
lightfoot_ch753=>which border of old was |Kadesh|-|barnea|, Numbers 34:4; Joshua 15:3.

lightfoot_ch801=>Pliny writes, "From |Pelusium| are the intrenchments of |Chabrias| : mount |Casius| :
lightfoot_ch802=>the temple of |Jupiter| |Casius| : the tomb of |Pompey| the Great: |Ostracine|:
lightfoot_ch803=>Arabia is bounded sixty-five miles from |Pelusium|:
lightfoot_ch804=>soon after begins Idumea and Palestine from the rising up of the |Sirbon| lake.
lightfoot_ch805=>" Either my eyes deceive me, while I read these things,
lightfoot_ch806=>-- or mount |Casius| lies nearer |Pelusium|, than the lake of |Sirbon|.
lightfoot_ch807=>The maps have ill placed the |Sirbon| between mount |Casius| and |Pelusium|.
lightfoot_ch808=>|Sirbon| implies burning; the name of the lake being derived from its nature, which is fiery and bituminous.
lightfoot_ch809=>It is described by |Diodorus| |Siculus|, Strabo, and others, whom you may look upon.
lightfoot_ch810=>A lake like to that of Sodom, and perhaps was of the like fate and original;
lightfoot_ch811=>to wit, an example of divine indignation.
lightfoot_ch812=>What if it be the monument of that dreadful earthquake in the days of |Uzziah|,
lightfoot_ch813=>Amos 1:1, Zechariah 14:5? when God contended also in fire, Amos 7:4:
lightfoot_ch814=>so that some cities perished after the manner of Sodom and Gomorrha, Amos 4:11; Isaiah 1:9.
lightfoot_ch815=>The farthest border of the land of Israel southward is not Nile in Egypt, but Shihor in the way to Egypt,
lightfoot_ch816=>Joshua 13:3; Jeremiah 2:18. In the Seventy interpreters, it is Rhinocorura;
lightfoot_ch817=>for they render that in Isaiah 27:12, "unto the stream of Egypt." "Unto Rhinocorura."
lightfoot_ch818=>Of which place and name, derived from the 'cutting of nostrils,' see Diodorus Siculus, lib.1. [60.]
