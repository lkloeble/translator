nkjv_genesis_chapter1A=>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1B=>The earth was without form@N, and void; and darkness was on the face@1 of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters@N.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1C=>Then God said, Let there be light; and there was light.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1D=>And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1E=>God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1F=>Then God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters@N, and let it divide the waters@N from the waters@N."
nkjv_genesis_chapter1G=>Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters@N which were under the firmament from the waters@N which were above the firmament; and it was so.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1H=>And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1I=>Then God said, Let the waters@N under the heavens be gathered together into one place@N, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1J=>And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters@N He called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1K=>Then God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth; and it was so.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1L=>And the earth brought forth grass, the herb that yields seed according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1M=>So the evening and the morning were the third day.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1N=>Then God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years;
nkjv_genesis_chapter1O=>and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth; and it was so.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1P=>Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1Q=>God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth,
nkjv_genesis_chapter1R=>and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1S=>So the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1T=>Then God said, Let the waters@N abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1U=>So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters@N abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1V=>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters@N in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1W=>So the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1X=>Then God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according to its kind; and it was so.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1Y=>And God made the beast of the earth according to its kind, cattle according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1Z=>Then God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1AA=>So God created man in His own@P image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1BB=>Then God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1CC=>And God said, See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1DD=>Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food; and it was so.
nkjv_genesis_chapter1EE=>Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2A=>Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2B=>And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2C=>Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2D=>This is the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,
nkjv_genesis_chapter2E=>before any plant@N of the field was in the earth and before any herb of the field had grown. For the Lord God had not caused it to rain@V on the earth, and there was no man to till@V the ground;
nkjv_genesis_chapter2F=>but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2G=>And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2H=>The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2I=>And out of the ground the Lord God made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2J=>Now a river went out of Eden to water@V the garden, and from there it parted and became four riverheads.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2K=>The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which skirts the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2L=>And the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and the onyx stone are there.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2M=>The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one which goes around the whole land of Cush.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2N=>The name of the third river is Hiddekel; it is the one which goes toward the east of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2O=>Then the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2P=>And the Lord God commanded the man, saying : Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat;
nkjv_genesis_chapter2Q=>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2R=>And the Lord God said, It is not good that man should be alone; I will@V make him a helper comparable to him.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2S=>Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2T=>So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2U=>And the Lord God caused a deep sleep@N to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place@N.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2V=>Then the rib which the Lord God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2W=>And Adam said : This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2X=>Therefore a man shall leave@V his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
nkjv_genesis_chapter2Y=>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3A=>Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, Has God indeed said : You shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
nkjv_genesis_chapter3B=>And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden
nkjv_genesis_chapter3C=>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3D=>Then the serpent said to the woman, You will@V not surely die.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3E=>For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will@V be opened, and you will@V be like God, knowing good and evil.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3F=>So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3G=>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves@N together and made themselves coverings.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3H=>And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3I=>Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, Where are you ?
nkjv_genesis_chapter3J=>So he said, I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3K=>And He said, Who told you that you were naked ? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat ?
nkjv_genesis_chapter3L=>Then the man said, The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3M=>And the Lord God said to the woman, What is this you have done ? The woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3N=>So the Lord God said to the serpent: Because you have done this, You are cursed more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your belly you shall go, And you shall eat dust All the days of your life.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3O=>And I will@V put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3P=>To the woman He said: I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; In pain you shall bring forth children; Your desire@N shall be for your husband, And he shall rule over you.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3Q=>Then to Adam He said, Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying : You shall not eat of it : Cursed is the ground for your sake; In toil you shall eat of it All the days of your life.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3R=>Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, And you shall eat the herb of the field.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3S=>In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread Till you return to the ground, For out of it you were taken; For dust you are, And to dust you shall return.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3T=>And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3U=>Also for Adam and his wife the Lord God made tunics of skin, and clothed them.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3V=>Then the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like@P one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"
nkjv_genesis_chapter3W=>therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken.
nkjv_genesis_chapter3X=>So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4A=>Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, " I have acquired a man from the Lord. "
nkjv_genesis_chapter4B=>Then she bore again, this time his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4C=>And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to the Lord.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4D=>Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord respected Abel and his offering,
nkjv_genesis_chapter4E=>but He did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4F=>So the Lord said to Cain, " Why are you angry ? And why has your countenance fallen ?
nkjv_genesis_chapter4G=>If you do well, will you not be accepted ? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door. And its desire@N is for you, but you should rule over it."
nkjv_genesis_chapter4H=>Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4I=>Then the Lord said to Cain, " Where is Abel your brother ? " He said, " I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper ? "
nkjv_genesis_chapter4J=>And He said, " What have you done ? The voice of your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4K=>So now you are cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4L=>When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth."
nkjv_genesis_chapter4M=>And Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is greater than I can bear@1 !
nkjv_genesis_chapter4N=>Surely You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; I shall be hidden from Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, and it will happen that anyone who finds me will kill me."
nkjv_genesis_chapter4O=>And the Lord said to him, "Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold." And the Lord set a mark on Cain, lest anyone finding him should kill him.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4P=>Then Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4Q=>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4R=>To Enoch was born |Irad|; and |Irad| begot |Mehujael|, and |Mehujael| begot |Methushael|, and |Methushael| begot |Lamech|.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4S=>Then Lamech took for himself two wives : the name of one was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4T=>And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4U=>His brother's name was Jubal. He was the father of all those who play the harp and flute.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4V=>And as for Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every craftsman in bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was |Naamah|.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4W=>Then Lamech said to his wives: "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, listen to my speech ! For I have killed a man for wounding me, Even a young man for hurting me.
nkjv_genesis_chapter4X=>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold."
nkjv_genesis_chapter4Y=>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, "For God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel, whom Cain killed."
nkjv_genesis_chapter4Z=>And as for Seth, to him also a son was born; and he named him |Enosh|. Then men began to call on the name of the Lord.


leviathan_prefaceA=>Nature (the art whereby God hath made and governs the world) is by the art of man, as in many other things, so in this also imitated, that it can make an Artificial Animal.
leviathan_prefaceB=>For seeing life is but a motion of Limbs, the begining whereof is in some principall part@N within; why may we not say, that all Automata (Engines that move themselves by springs@1 and wheeles as doth a watch@1) have an artificiall life ?
leviathan_prefaceC=>For what is the Heart, but a Spring@1; and the Nerves, but so many Strings; and the Joynts, but so many Wheeles, giving motion to the whole Body, such as was intended by the Artificer ?
leviathan_prefaceD=>Art goes yet further, imitating that Rationall and most excellent worke of Nature, Man.
leviathan_prefaceE=>For by Art is created that great LEVIATHAN called a COMMON-WEALTH, or STATE, (in latine |CIVITAS|) which is but an Artificiall Man;
leviathan_prefaceF=>though of greater stature and strength than the Naturall, for whose protection and defence it was intended;
leviathan_prefaceG=>and in which, the Soveraignty is an Artificiall Soul, as giving life and motion to the whole body;
leviathan_prefaceH=>The Magistrates, and other Officers of Judicature and Execution, artificiall Joynts; Reward and Punishment (by which fastned to the seat of the Soveraignty, every joynt and member is moved to performe his duty) are the Nerves, that do the same in the Body Naturall;
leviathan_prefaceI=>The Wealth and Riches of all the particular members, are the Strength; |Salus| |Populi| (the Peoples@1 Safety) its Businesse;
leviathan_prefaceJ=>Counsellors, by whom all things needfull for it to know, are suggested unto it, are the Memory; Equity and Lawes, an artificiall Reason and Will;
leviathan_prefaceK=>Concord, Health; Sedition, Sicknesse; and Civill War, Death.
leviathan_prefaceL=>Lastly, the Pacts and Covenants, by which the parts of this Body |Politique| were at first made, set together, and united, resemble that |Fiat|, or the Let Us Make Man, pronounced by God in the Creation.
leviathan_prefaceM=>To describe the Nature of this Artificiall man, I will consider First the Matter thereof, and the Artificer; both which is Man.
leviathan_prefaceN=>Secondly, How, and by what Covenants it is made; what are the Rights and just Power or Authority of a Soveraigne; and what it is that Preserveth and Dissolveth it.
leviathan_prefaceO=>Thirdly, what is a Christian Common-Wealth.
leviathan_prefaceP=>Lastly, what is the Kingdome of Darkness.
leviathan_prefaceQ=>Concerning the first, there is a saying much usurped@1 of late, That Wisedome is acquired, not by reading@N of Books@N, but of Men. Consequently whereunto, those persons, that for the most part can give no other proof of being wise, take great delight to shew what they think they have read in men, by uncharitable censures of one another behind their backs.
leviathan_prefaceR=>But there is another saying not of late understood, by which they might learn truly to read one another, if they would take the pains; and that is, |Nosce| |Te| |ipsum|, Read Thy Self:
leviathan_prefaceS=>which was not meant, as it is now used, to countenance, either the barbarous state of men in power, towards their inferiors;
leviathan_prefaceT=>or to encourage men of low degree, to a sawcie behaviour towards their betters; But to teach us, that for the similitude of the thoughts, and Passions of one man, to the thoughts, and Passions of another, whosoever looketh into himselfe, and considereth what he doth, when he does Think, Opine, Reason, Hope@N, Feare, etc, and upon what grounds;
leviathan_prefaceU=>he shall thereby read and know, what are the thoughts, and Passions of all other men, upon the like occasions.
leviathan_prefaceV1=>I say the similitude of Passions, which are the same in all men, Desire, Feare, Hope, etc;
leviathan_prefaceV2=>not the similitude or The Objects of the Passions, which are the things Desired, Feared, Hoped, etc:
leviathan_prefaceW1=>for these the constitution individuall, and particular education do so vary, and they are so easie to be kept from our knowledge,
leviathan_prefaceW2=>that the characters of mans heart, blotted and confounded as they are, with dissembling, lying, counterfeiting, and erroneous doctrines, are legible onely to him that searcheth hearts.
leviathan_prefaceX=>And though by mens actions wee do discover their designee sometimes; yet to do it without comparing them with our own, and distinguishing all circumstances, by which the case may come to be altered, is to decypher without a key, and be for the most part deceived, by too much trust, or by too much diffidence; as he that reads, is himselfe a good or evill man.
leviathan_prefaceY=>But let one man read another by his actions never so perfectly, it serves him onely with his acquaintance, which are but few. He that is to govern a whole Nation, must read in himselfe, not this, or that particular man; but Man-kind;
leviathan_prefaceZ=>which though it be hard to do, harder than to learn any Language, or Science;
leviathan_prefaceAA=>yet, when I shall have set down my own reading orderly, and perspicuously, the pains left another, will be onely to consider, if he also find not the same in himselfe.
leviathan_prefaceBB=>For this kind of Doctrine, admitteth no other Demonstration.
