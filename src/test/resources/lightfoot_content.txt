lightfoot_page1A=>during the middle ages, the Talmud was the exclusive property of the jews. Tragically it was not even allowed to be their property, for the persecutions of the jewish heretics (and later of the protestant heretics too) extended also to their sacred books@N.
lightfoot_page1B=>As a consequence, very few manuscripts of the babylonian and jerusalem talmuds survive. With the revival of hebrew and the study of hebrew bible that came with the reformation, there came also an interest in other jewish works. One of the fine fruits of this movement was the work of the hebraist john lightfoot (1602 - 1675)
lightfoot_page1C=>Lightfoot was one of many earnest christian scholars of his time. Master of St Catherine Hall@1, Cambridge, he possessed the classical learning@N of those days. He was at home in Latin and Greek, and he was a master not only of classical hebrew, but also of mishnaic hebrew and the aramaic of the Talmud.
lightfoot_page1D=>We are reminded of his elder contemporary |Lancelot| |Andrewes|, one of the translators of the King James Version of the Bible, who composed prayers for himself in hebrew !
lightfoot_page1E=>Aside from lightfoot's scholarly writings and productive teaching@N, he took part in westminster assembly, which sat from 1643 to 1649. He belonged to the erastian party, favoring an established church, and this is reflected in the present work in his letter of thanks to |Gilbert|, who lightfoot says is, by divine providence, archbishop of |canterbury|, primate of all england.
lightfoot_page2A=>Lightfoot lived in troubled times. Born in the last days of Queen Elizabeth, he was a boy when the King James Version was published. He sat in the Westminster Assembly while the |Long| parliament beheaded King Charles |I|, then somehow survived the restoration under Charles |II|, all the while maintaining a real Christian testimony and making an important scholarly contribution to scripture study.
lightfoot_page2B=>From his commentary one would hardly guess at the turbulent times in which he lived.
lightfoot_page2C=>One point is of interest. In the days of |Oliver| |Cromwell|, when Lightfoot was at the height of his powers, the jews were allowed again in England after 250 years of proscription.
lightfoot_page2D=>Lightfoot's commentary should be compared with the |Kommentar| |zum| |neuen| |testament| by |Strack| and |Billerbeck|. This extensive german commentary is the only other work that attempts fully to use the Talmud and related jewish material in elucidating the New Testament.
lightfoot_page2E=>|Strack|-|Billerbeck| is more extensive than lightfoot, includes the whole new testament, and is more recent.
lightfoot_page2F=>But the Talmud has not changed since lightfoot's day, though obviously Talmud studies have advanced.
lightfoot_page2G=>Lightfoot's comment on the new Testament text and his use of the Talmud reflect his theologically conservative stance, however, and of course Lightfoot is in English.
lightfoot_page2H=>(Lightfoot's commentary, which was originally published between 1658 and 1674, was written in latin. It was translated in english and published in four volumes in 1859. The title of this edition was |horae| |hebraicae| |et| |talmudicae| : hebrew and talmudical exercitations... this is the edition here being reprinted)
lightfoot_page2I=>an interesting comparison of the two works appears in their comments on luke 3:23 : Jesus was "(as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli ". Lightfoot's view of Luke's meaning@N is that Jesus was the legal son of Joseph but the natural son (grandson) of Heli through Mary;
lightfoot_page2J=>Jesus was then the son (great grandson) of Matthat and so on to Seth, and Jesus was thus the son of Adam and the Son of God (see vol 3 p 54).
lightfoot_page3A=>This view is not widely adopted today, the tendency being to leave@V Joseph with two fathers, or more commonly to see a contradiction between the genealogies of Matthew and Luke.
lightfoot_page3B=>But Lightfoot's data as to such a series in Genesis 36:2 have not been answered.
lightfoot_page3C=>Note that in the previous verse Luke quotes the voice at Jesus Baptism that said Jesus was the son of God.
lightfoot_page3D=>Also we know from Romans 1:3 that Paul, Luke's mentor, was concerned with Jesus physical ancestry.
lightfoot_page3E=>Lightfoot supports this view with a citation from the tractate Hagigah of the Jerusalem Talmud.
lightfoot_page3F=>According to this passage someone in his sleep saw " Mary the daughter of Heli (|'ly|) amongst the shades (|bslym|) " * in torment, hanging by her breast and with the great bar of hell's gate hanging at her ear.
lightfoot_page3G=>The reference to Mary as daughter of Heli is, of course, most important.
lightfoot_page3H=>Since the Jerusalem Talmud has not been translated into english, and has been only partly into german, we can compare Lightfoot's translation only with the french : |il| |voyait| |Miriam| |la| |fille| |d'Ali|-|Becalim|.
lightfoot_page3I=>But |Strack|-|Billerbeck| rejects the translation " Mary the daughter of Heli " and instead renders the consonants |ly| |bslym| " onion leaves@N " (|Zwiebelblatt|)..
lightfoot_page3J=>It does not explain, however, why Mary would be hanging by her breasts in an onion patch !.
lightfoot_page3K=>This seems almost a desperate effort to avoid a reference to Mary as daughter of Heli..
lightfoot_page3L=>These suggestions of Lightfoot appear to be the only one that make sense, which evidently means@V that Jewish tradition – either from original knowledge or from reading@N the New Testament – considered Mary the Daughter of Heli. |**|.
lightfoot_page3M=>* : it may be possible to improve on Lightfoot's translation of |bslym| (aramaic of |besalim|) as " amongst the shades ". The first part of this compound word is the preposition |beth| " among " or " in ".
lightfoot_page3N=>Lightfoot apparently takes the second part to be the masculine plural of the hebrew |sal| " shadow " or " shade@1 ".
lightfoot_page3O=>But |sal| usually refers to a shadow that protects. The second part of |bslym| might instead be |slm|, " deep gloom ", a root@N attested in arabic and akkadian ;
lightfoot_page3P=>thus some translate |salmaweth|, " shadow of death " as |salmuth|, " deep gloom ". Mary, then, was in the deep darkness.
lightfoot_page3Q=>|**| tradition also said that Mary is suffering in hell because of her boastfulness.
lightfoot_page3R=>This seems a very light@1 cause for such severe punishment, unless she was thought to have boasted that she was, as Christian claimed, the Mother of God.
lightfoot_page4A=>This is a good example of a novel approach in interpretation by lightfoot that has been largely neglected by many and rejected by some@1 without an adequate alternative
lightfoot_page4B=>Lightfoot fortunately gives us in crucial places@N the hebrew or aramaics phrases on which he bases his views
lightfoot_page4C=>This is important because it is sometimes a chore to check his quotations
lightfoot_page4D=>It may be mentioned that his occasional enigmatic footnotes refering to " english |folio| edition " or " |leusden| edition " refer to earlier editions of his own@P writings in english or latin
lightfoot_page4E=>These are not easily available, but it is not essential to refer to them
lightfoot_page4F=>He worked in a day when there was no translation of either the babylonian or the jerusalem talmud
lightfoot_page4G=>The babylonian talmud has now been translated in english and german. An older english edition by |rodkinson| * is said to be unsatisfactory and in any case is divided into chapters and sections rather than by folio and page, the designation that lightfoot and most others use
lightfoot_page4H=>Now being published is the great soncino talmud, edited by |epstein| |**|, with hebrew aramaic and english on facing pages and divided by folio and page
lightfoot_page4I=>It is not yet complete, but the parts that have appeared can be handily used to follow up lightfoot's references
lightfoot_page4J=>Other parts can be easily consulted in the earlier soncino english translation |***|, which does not include the hebrew aramaic text, but which is complete
lightfoot_page4K=>The Jerusalem talmud, as previously remarked, has not been rendered into english, which is odd considering the significance of this work
lightfoot_page4L=>It has been translated into french, but unfortunately the french edition is also divided into chapters and verses, making it difficult to locate lightfoot's references
lightfoot_page4M=>* : Michael |L| |Rodkinson| |ed| New Edition of the Babylonian Talmud, 20 |vols| in 10 (|New||York| : New Talmud 1896 1903). For these editions see |Hermann| |L| |Strack|

lightfoot_page5A=>There are probably two dangers in talmud study, the one of underemphasis, the other of exaggeration.
lightfoot_page5B=>The talmud is a compilation of jewish tradition from early medieval times.
lightfoot_page5C=>The unanswered and likely unanswerable question is how accurately this tradition reflects early times.
lightfoot_page5D=>Doubtless a part this tradition is valid. The question is, which part ?
lightfoot_page5E=>In form the talmud is an interpretation and application of the mishna, and the mishna of the pentateuch.
lightfoot_page5F=>After the close of the old testament canon, when jews were conscious that prophecy had ceased *, leaders of jewish thought were faced with questions of ethics and practice that demanded new applications of the law.
lightfoot_page5G=>These precedents were discussed by generations of scholars called tannaim, and their deliberations became a body of traditional opinion.
lightfoot_page5H=>In about |A|. |D|. 200 these oral traditions were written down in the mishna in six divisions (called " orders@N ") comprising sixty three chapters (tractates).
lightfoot_page5I=>These were written in a late dialect of hebrew called mishnaic hebrew.
lightfoot_page5J=>As time went on, more discussion gave rise to more precedents, and these discussion of later generations of scholars, called amoraïm, were written down in aramaic.
lightfoot_page5K=>These aramaic chapters (gemara) were appended to the paragraphs of the mishna, sp the talmud has a paragraph of hebrew followed by aramaic commentary.
lightfoot_page5L=>It was written down A.D. 500 in two recensions : the palestinian or jerusalem talmud, and the longer and more widely used babylonian talmud.
lightfoot_page5M=>It will@V be observed that the jews did not begin to write down these traditions until A.D. 200, and the Talmud was not completed until 500.
lightfoot_page5N=>The talmudic manuscripts that survived the medieval burnings of jewish books are few and come from the middle ages.
lightfoot_page5O=>Therefore they should be used with some caution in interpreting the New Testament.
lightfoot_page5P=>The New Testament histories were written down within one lifetime of the death of Christ – most of them within about forty years.

lightfoot_ch1A=>The division of the land
lightfoot_ch1B=>The jewish writers divide the whole world into ארצ ישראל "the land of Israel" and חוצה לארצ "without the land" : that is, the countries of heathen.
lightfoot_ch1C=>Both which phrases the book of the gospel owns : "the land of israel", Matt. II 20 and it calls the heathens, |τους| |εξω|, " those that are without " |I| Cor V 13, |I| Tm 3:7, and sometimes the unbelieving jews themselves, as Mark 4:2.
lightfoot_ch1D=>They distinguish all the people of the world into |ישראל| "israelites" and |אומות| |העולם| "the nations of the world".
lightfoot_ch1E=>The book@N of the gospel own that phrase also, Mt 6:32 |παντα| |ταυτα| |τα| |εθνη| |επιζητει| "after all these things, do the gentiles (or nations) seek : " which is in luke 12:30 is |εθνη| |του| |κοσμου| "the nations of the world".
lightfoot_ch1F=>Hence the word "world" is most commonly used for the gentiles ; John 3:16-17, 1 Jn 2:2, etc.
lightfoot_ch1G=>Somewhere a distinction is made into |ארצ| "the land [ of israel ] ", and מדינת הים "the region of the sea" וכל חל קרי מדינת הים בר מבבל "and every foreign region is called the region of the sea, except Babylon " - they are the words of rabbi Solomon *.
lightfoot_ch1H=>Which, nevertheless, fall under the censure of R. Nissim ** : "it is something hard (saith he) to reckon every country, which is out of the land, to be the region of the sea : for then, under that name, would be included all the neighbouring places, and which are, as it were, swallowed up by the land.
lightfoot_ch1I=>They say, therefore, that the more remote places are called מדינת הים " The region of the sea " ?
lightfoot_ch1J=>But neither@1 does this please me : for there is no need of so great distance, to make any place to be called, " the region of the sea ".
lightfoot_ch1K=>But it is spoken in relation to the western coast of the land of Israel ;
lightfoot_ch1L=>on which side there are no [ heathen ] cities near, and swallowed up by the land.
lightfoot_ch1M=>But the sea sets the bound ; but it doth not set the bounds@N on other sides, etc.
lightfoot_ch1N=>The sense, therefore, of R. Solomon, when he saith "  that every region, without the land, is the region of the sea " comes to this, - that every region, which is like to that region, is so called.
lightfoot_ch1O=>* R. Sol in Gittin, cap I
lightfoot_ch1P=>** R. Nissim ibid
lightfoot_ch1Q=>Heathen cities were on that western coast ; but seeing they lay within the ancient bounds@N of the land, namely, the " lip@1 of the mediterranean sea " –
lightfoot_ch1R=>they could not so properly be said to be " without the land ", as those which were altogether " without the limits@N ".
lightfoot_ch1S=>Those cities and that country, therefore, are called by a peculiar title, מדינת הים that is the  " coast or country by the mediterranean sea ".
lightfoot_ch1T=>Which title all other cities of the like condition underwent also, wheresoever seated within the bounds@N of the land.
lightfoot_ch1U=>Examples will not be wanting as we go along.
lightfoot_ch1V=>They commonly define the " land of Israel " under a double notion : to wit, that (hebrew) " which they possessed, who went up out of egypt " and that (hebrew) " which they possessed, who went up out of babylon ".
lightfoot_ch1W=>This was, in very many places, circumscribed within narrower limits@N than that, not only by reason Samaria was rejected and shut out, but also, because certain portions were cut off (and they neither a few nor small), which became the possessions of those, that went up out of Egypt ;
lightfoot_ch1X=>but, under the second temple, had passed into the possession of the heathen.
lightfoot_ch1Y=>Now they were, upon this account, the more exact in observing their bounds@N, distinguishing this land by known bounds@N, both from all others, and, in some places, as it were, from himself ;
lightfoot_ch1Z=>because they decreed, that very many mysteries of their religion were to be handled nowhere but within these limits@N.
lightfoot_ch1AA=>For (|e|) besides the rites of that dispensation, which the holy scriptures doth openly and evidently fix to that land, such as sacrifices, passovers, the priesthood (|f|), and other appointments of that nature (which are commonly, and not improperly, called (hebrew) ( " Statutes appendant to that land "), very many others also are circumscribed within the same borders by the fathers of the traditions. " the land of Israel (say they (|g|)), above all other lands, is sanctified by ten holinesses. And what is the holiness of it ? Out of it they bring the sheaf, and the first-fruits, and the two loaves. And they do not so out of any other land ".
lightfoot_ch1BB=>"The law of beheading the cow doth not take place anywhere, but in the land of Israel, and beyond Jordan (|h|) ".
lightfoot_ch1CC=>"they do not appoint of determine concerning the new moons, nor do they intercalate the year any where but in the land of Israel : as it is said, the law shall go forth out of Sion (|i|)".
lightfoot_ch1DD=>"They do not prefer the eldership out of the land of Israel : no, not although they that do prefer, have themselves been preferred within the land (|j|)"
lightfoot_ch1EE=>And that I heap not together more, they do, in a manner, circumscribe the Holy Spirit himself within the limits@N of that land.
lightfoot_ch1FF=>For "Shekhina (say they (|k|)) dwells not upon any out of the land". Compare Act |X|:45.
lightfoot_ch1GG=>The land which the Jews, that came up out of Babylon, possess, they divide after this manner :
lightfoot_ch1HH=>"there (|l|) are three lands (or countries), (hebrew), Judea, the land beyond Jordan, and Galilee; and each of those have three countries : " – those we shall take notice of in their places. To this received division our Saviour hath respect, when sending his disciples to preach to the "lost sheep of Israel" he excludes Samaria, Matt |X|:5; which according to the condition of the nation, was not merely heathen, nor was it truly Israel.
lightfoot_ch1II=>It was not heathen; for (|m|) (hebrew) "the land of Samaria is reckoned clean, and the gathering together of its waters clean, and its dwelling clean, and its paths clean" which the jewish curiosity would by no means@N pronounce of a heathen land. But as to many other things, they made no difference between them and the gentiles.
lightfoot_ch1JJ=>The jewish doctors do, indeed, particularly apply that division of the three countries in the place alleged, to the tradition and canon concerning (hebrew) ; but yet they do everywhere retain the same, wheresoever they treat of the division of the land of Israel.
lightfoot_ch1KK=>What (hebrew) means, you may learn from the authors of the gloss@1 upon the place.
lightfoot_ch1LL=>Briefly it was this : in their seventh year they might eat of the fruit laid up in their storehouses, so long as some fruit of that kind hung upon the tree in that country : but when they could no more find them upon the trees, they were to cast out those which they had gathered, and laid up at home, and not to eat of them, as they did before.
lightfoot_ch2A=>The Talmudic Girdle of the land under the second temple, taken out of the Jerusalem |Sheviit|, fol 36.3 (hebrew) ibid col, 4
lightfoot_ch2B1=>What all these things mean@V, I cannot so much as conjecture; yea, nor can I scarce@1 conjecture, what the meaning@N is of some of them.
lightfoot_ch2B2=>Neither is there any |Oedipus| at hand, nor |Sphinx| herself, to explain and unriddle them. The talmudists are silent from making any comments here, nor have we the advantage of any other commentator.
lightfoot_ch2B3=>We must, therefore, act here according to the uncertain instruction of nods and winks; and that either by saying nothing, or by mere conjecture, since that the mind of the authors is neither altogether unknown, or it is wholly doubtful, whether it be known or no.
lightfoot_ch2B4=>Expect not, that I go from street to street to knock at all the gates of these places : it will be enough, if we can scrape out, in what regions these places lie, and are able to guess at what points of the heaven they are disposed.
lightfoot_ch2B5=>We will at present take in hand only the first and last clause of this place quoted; which may have some tendency towards entrance into our present business.
lightfoot_ch2B6=>The rest (if there be any we can attain unto) we shall handle in their proper places.
lightfoot_ch2C=>"These (say they) are the bounds of the land of Israel, which they possessed that came out of Babylon".
lightfoot_ch2D=>"The division, or part, of the walls of the tower |Sid|". Nor dare I confidently to assert, that this is spoken of the "tower of |Strato|" or "Caesarea"; nor yet do I know to what it may more fitly be applied. We observe in its place, that that tower is called by the talmudists,
lightfoot_ch2E=>"the tower of |Sir|" : which by how very little a point it differs from this word, and how very apt it is by want of care in writing to be confounded with it, the eye of any reader is witness.
lightfoot_ch2F=>It may happily confirm this conjecture, that the name |Aco|, so soon follows only coming between.
lightfoot_ch2G=>Concerning which we have nothing to say, if that, which we meet with in the writers of the Babylonian Talmud, may not have any place here.
lightfoot_ch2H=>They say [ p ] &c. "Go in the lowest way, below the mountains" and they will protect you from showers and rain@N. Hence, therefore, it may be supposed, that the word שינ" doth denote some way at the foot of some mountainous place, which was, as it were, the dividing line between the 'land of Israël ' and 'without the land'; perhaps at the foot of mount Carmel : but we do not assert it : we had rather profess silence and ignorance, than, by a light of conjecture, either to deceive others or be deceived ourselves.
lightfoot_ch2I=>These places, concerning which the talmudists here treat, are of a different condition from those, which were called
lightfoot_ch2J=>"the region of the sea". For those places were certain towns, here and there, on this sea-coast, and elsewhere; which were, indeed, inhabited by heathens, and so could not properly reckoned the ' land of Israël '; yet they were such, as between which, and the outmost bounds of the land, was again the land of Israël. But these places, which we are now handling, are those, which were the utmost bounds, and beyond which were no places at all, but what was reckoned the ' land of the heathen ' : the phoenicians, syrians, or other gentiles, possessing all that coast thence forward unto the shore of the mediterranean sea.
lightfoot_ch2K=>We cannot also pass by those things, that are said by the gemarists in the very same page, from whence the scheme before-mentioned is taken.
lightfoot_ch2L=>&c. "You see isles in the sea; and if a line were drawn from the mountains of |Amana| to the river of Egypt, - whatsoever it within the line, belongs to the land of Israel;
lightfoot_ch2M=>whatsoever is without the line, is without the land" after the same manner speaks the Targum of Jerusalem upon Num XXXIV: : "and their western bounds@N shall be the great sea, and the isle of it".
lightfoot_ch2N=>Isles ? What isles ? Let the authors of the maps well weigh these passages.
lightfoot_ch3A=>A great part of south Judea cut off under the second Temple. Jewish Idumea.
lightfoot_ch3B=>The Talmudic girdle ends, as you see in (hebrew) "|Kadesh|, |Barnea| and |Ascalon|".
lightfoot_ch3C=>Hence it cannot but be observed, that these two places are placed, as it were, in parallel;
lightfoot_ch3D=>and whatsoever space lies between |Ascalon| and the river of Egypt, is excluded, - to wit, fifty four miles.
lightfoot_ch3E=>And one might indeed, almost see some footsteps of that exclusion under the first Temple, in that very common expression, "from Dan even to |BeerSheva|".
lightfoot_ch3F=>This country, that was excluded, was something barren.
lightfoot_ch3G=>The Talmudist speak thus of it; "that tract@1, which lies in |gerariku| |[gerar]| is ill to dwell in.
lightfoot_ch3H=>How far ? to the river of Egypt". And Strabo thus; "the country , which follows gaza is barren, and sandy" etc.
lightfoot_ch3I=>It was anciently inhabited by the avites, - namely, from gaza to the river of Egypt.
lightfoot_ch3J=>"the |avim| dwelt in |hazerim|", Deut II 23. |Hazar| is a word of most frequent mention  in that southern land, "hazar-addar, hazar-gaddah, hazar-shua, hazar-susah", etc.
lightfoot_ch3K=>And it seems to denote some champaign plain and level, lying between the mountains. Hence the habitation of the avites is called '|hazerim|';
lightfoot_ch3L=>who are numbered with the philistines, but yet by themselves, Jos 13:3. – for see there, how the holy text promising to number five nations only, number six.
lightfoot_ch3M=>This excluded portion is passed into the name of Idumea.
lightfoot_ch3N=>Hence |Pliny| : "presently from the rising up of the lake |Sirbon|, begins Idumea and Palestine".
lightfoot_ch3O=>Nor that alone, but another very great part of Judea.
lightfoot_ch3P=>Hence the sea of Sodom, is said, by |Diodorus| |Siculus| to be [ greek ]  "about the middle of Idumea".
lightfoot_ch3Q=>And in Josephus, and the book@N of the Maccabees, we find very many places mentioned under the name of Idumea, which were almost in the very middle of Judea.
lightfoot_ch3R=>For example's sake [ greek ] "he came even to the |gadari| and the plains of Idumea, and |Azotus| and |Jamnia|".
lightfoot_ch3S=>And again [greek] etc. [greek] etc. [greek]
lightfoot_ch3T=>"and Judas and his brethren left not off fighting with the idumeans : but fell upon them everywhere.
lightfoot_ch3U=>And taking the city |Chebron|, etc. And the city |Marissa|, etc. And having come unto |Azotus|", etc. And more to this purpose may be read here and there.
lightfoot_ch3V=>So that distinction may be made, between Idumea the greater and the less.
lightfoot_ch3W=>Simon of Gerasa [greek] overran the towns along the mountainous country etc.
lightfoot_ch3X=>And he overran |Acrabatene|, and the parts as far as Idumea the Great".
lightfoot_ch3Y=>And there in mention of [greek] "Idumea, called the Upper".
lightfoot_ch3Z=>With these passages, compare Mark 3:8.
lightfoot_ch3AA=>Whilst the Jews were absent from their own country, enduring the seventy years bondage in Babylone –
lightfoot_ch3BB=>it is easy to be believed, that their ancient enemies, the Edomites, and that were so from the very first original of them,
lightfoot_ch3CC=>had invaded their possessions, as much as they could, and had fixed their roots@N in that country especially, which was nearest their own :
lightfoot_ch3DD=>but at length, by the powerful arms of the Maccabees, and the asmoneans, they were either rooted out, or constrained to embrace Judaism.
lightfoot_ch3EE=>So Josephus speaks of |Hyrcanus| [greek] etc. "|Hyrcanus| takes |Ador| and |Marissa|, cities of Idumea :
lightfoot_ch3FF=>and having subdued all the idumeans, suffered them to remain in the country, on condition they were willing to be circumcised, and to use the jewish laws.
lightfoot_ch3GG=>And they, out of a desire@N of their own country, underwent circumcision, and conformed to the same course of life with the Jews".
lightfoot_ch3HH=>Hence there became a mingled generation in that country between Jew and Edomite : and the name of the place was mingled also, and called both Idumea and Judea :
lightfoot_ch3II=>"And Palestine was divided into five countries – Idumea, Judea, Samaria, Galilee, and the country beyond Jordan"
lightfoot_ch4A=>The seven seas according to the talmudists, and the four rivers compassing the land.
lightfoot_ch4B=>Seven seas and four rivers compass the land of Israël.
lightfoot_ch4C=>1 [hebrew] The great sea, or the Mediterranean.
lightfoot_ch4D=>2 [hebrew] The sea of Tiberias.
lightfoot_ch4E=>3 [hebrew] The sea of Sodom.
lightfoot_ch4F=>4 [hebrew] the lake of |Sachomo|.
lightfoot_ch4G=>5 [hebrew] o. 6 [hebrew] o. 7 [hebrew] o.
lightfoot_ch4H=>These four last are otherwise writ in the Jerusalem Talmud : to wit, thus, 4 [hebrew] o .
lightfoot_ch4I=>5 [hebrew] o. 6 [hebrew] o. 7  [hebrew] . In the Babylonian Talmud thus : 4 [hebrew]  o .
lightfoot_ch4J=>5 [hebrew]  o. 6  [hebrew] o. 7 [hebrew] o.
lightfoot_ch4K=>The three first named among the seven are sufficiently known, and there is no doubt of the fourth :only the three names of it are not to be passed by.
lightfoot_ch4L=>4. 1    The |sibbichaean|. The word seems to be derived from [hebrew] a bush.
lightfoot_ch4M=>2. [hebrew], which seems to sound the same thing : for [hebrew]  thorns, among the targumists, are [hebrew];
lightfoot_ch4N=>because that lake, having no great depth, but very much dried in the summer time, was grown over with thorns and bushes.
lightfoot_ch4O=>3 [hebrew], from whence the common name |samochonitis|, the letter (|mem|) and (|beth|) being changed in [hebrew] and [hebrew].
lightfoot_ch4P=>5 [hebrew] perhaps the sandy sea. Which fits very well to the lake of |Sirbon|, joining the commentary of |Diodorus| |Siculus|.
lightfoot_ch4Q=>For he relates, that that lake; for the most part; is so covered with sand, that it hath often deceived and supplanted travelers, yea, whole armies, thinking it to be firm land.
lightfoot_ch4R=>6 [hebrew] We have nothing to say of this, besides this observation, that since it is called by the same gemarists [hebrew], the guttural (|'heth|) seems to be melted into (|yod|);
lightfoot_ch4S=>which is not unusual to the dialect of the nation, so to smooth and soften guttural letters. It is also called, by the Babylonians, [hebrew],
lightfoot_ch4T=>which, among the talmudists, does sometimes signify rushy or sedgy : but what the sea is, we know not.
lightfoot_ch4U=>However, we do not forget the |cendevian| lake : but whether that be to be numbered among our catalogue, we doubt upon this reason, because on the same coast lies the great sea.
lightfoot_ch4V=>7 [hebrew] "the sea of |Apamia|". The Jerusalem writers, in both places, when they speak of that sea, add these words [hebrew] etc.
lightfoot_ch4W=>The sea of |Apamia| is the same with the sea of |Chamatz| [hebrew] etc. "|Dicletinus| caused it to be made by rivers gathered together".
lightfoot_ch4X=>It was, therefore, of a later date. Concerning it, see the sixty-eight chapter.
lightfoot_ch4Y=>After these seas, mentioned by the talmudists, hear also no lean story of theirs concerning the fish :
lightfoot_ch4Z=>"R. |Chaninah| Bar |Abhu| said, seven hundred kinds of clean fish, and eight hundred kinds of clean locusts, and of birds an infinite number, travelled with Israel into Babylone, and returned when Israel returned, except the fish [hebrew].
lightfoot_ch4AA=>But how did the fish travel ?
lightfoot_ch4BB=>R. |Houna| bar Joseph saith, [hebrew] they travelled by the way of the deep, and by the deep they came back."
lightfoot_ch4CC=>Surely it requires a jewish invention (which is able to frame any thing out of any thing), to trace a way, either by any sea, or by any river, through which fish might swim out of Palestine into Babylon.
lightfoot_ch4DD=>By the same art they bring Jonah in the belly of the whale, out of the Phoenician sea, into the red sea.
lightfoot_ch4EE=>That, indeed, is somewhat hard, yet no be doubted of, what is said, 2 Ch 8:18, concerning Hiram sending ships to Solomon into the red sea.
lightfoot_ch4FF=>What ! ships to come from |Tyre| into the red sea ? Which way sailed they ?
lightfoot_ch4GG=>it is answered, he sent such |tyrian| ships, which had much and long traded before in the red sea, to accompany Solomon's fleet.
lightfoot_ch4HH=>To this belongs that, that it is said there likewise (and in 1 Ro 9:27), that "he sent seamen, that had knowledge of the sea;" that is, knowledge of that sea :
lightfoot_ch4II=>and they probably not such, who had never yet adventured themselves into the red sea, but had experience of it before, and were not ignorant of the Ophir voyage.
lightfoot_ch4JJ=>The four rivers for the compassing of the land (they say) 1 [hebrew] Jordan; that is sufficiently known.
lightfoot_ch4KK=>2 [hebrew] Jarmoch. In Pliny, 'Hieramax' : "Gaddara (saith he), Hieramax flowing before it". 3 [hebrew] Kirmion. 4 [hebrew] Pigah.
lightfoot_ch4LL=>Concerning which the Aruch : "kirmion is a river in the way to Damascus, and is the same with Amanah. Pigah is Pharphar.
lightfoot_ch4MM=>And Jarmoch is also a river in the way to Damascus."
lightfoot_ch4NN=>And the talmudists : "the waters of |Kirmion| and |Pigah| are not fit" (to sprinkle the unclean), "because they are muddy waters.
lightfoot_ch4OO=>The waters also of Jordan, and the waters of |Jarmoch|, are not fit, because they are mixed waters:"
lightfoot_ch4PP=>that is, as the gloss speaks, mixed with the waters of other rivers, which they receive within themselves.
lightfoot_ch4QQ=>To the seven seas, concerning which we have spoken, those things which are said by |Midras| |Tillim|, do refer :
lightfoot_ch4RR=>"I have created seven seas, said the Lord, but out of them all I have chosen none, but the sea of |Gennesaret|".
lightfoot_ch4SS=>And of the river of |Amanah|, of which the |Aruch| speaks, mention is made in the Targum upon Can 4/8 :
lightfoot_ch4TT=>"they that dwell upon the river |Amanah|, shall offer thee a gift" etc.


lightfoot_ch5A01=>The sea of Sodom [hebrew]
lightfoot_ch5A02=>The bounds of Judea, on both sides, are the sea; the western bound is the Mediterranean, --
lightfoot_ch5A03=>the eastern, the Dead sea, or the sea of Sodom. This the Jewish writers every where call [hebrew],
lightfoot_ch5A04=>which you may not so properly interpret here, "the salt sea," as "the bituminous sea."
lightfoot_ch5A05=>In which sense [hebrew] word for word, "Sodom's salt," but properly "Sodom's bitumen," doth very frequently occur among them.
lightfoot_ch5A06=>The use of it was in the holy incense. They mingled [hebrew] bitumen, [hebrew] the amber of Jordan,
lightfoot_ch5A07=>and hebrew [an herb known to few], with the spices that made that incense.
lightfoot_ch5A08=>greek "The lake |Asphaltitis| is distant from Jerusalem three hundred furlongs":
lightfoot_ch5A09=>-- about eight-and-thirty miles.
lightfoot_ch5A10=>greek "It is extended in length five hundred and eighty furlongs";
lightfoot_ch5A11=>seventy-two miles. -- greek  "In breadth a hundred and fifty furlongs"; eighteen miles.
lightfoot_ch5A12=>Pliny speaks thus of it: "In length it is more than a hundred miles: in its greatest breadth, it makes five and twenty,
lightfoot_ch5A13=>-- in its least, six." What agreement is there between these two? I suppose Josephus does not comprehend within his measure the tongue of the sea,
lightfoot_ch5A14=>of which mention is made, Joshua 15:2 -- and defines the breadth, as it was generally every where diffused.
lightfoot_ch5A15=>Concerning its distance from Jerusalem, |Solinus| also speaks: "In a long retreat from Jerusalem (saith he) a sad bay openeth itself;
lightfoot_ch5A16=>which that it was struck from heaven, the ground, black and dissolved into ashes, testifies.
lightfoot_ch5A17=>There were two towns there, one named Sodom, the other Gomorrha."
lightfoot_ch5A18=>But that distance was not directly southward, but by a very long declination eastward.
lightfoot_ch5A19=>The Talmudists devote "to the sea of Sodom," hebrew any thing, that is destined to rejection and cursing, and that by no means is to be used.
lightfoot_ch5A20=>hebrew "Let him devote the use of such a thing to the bituminous sea."
lightfoot_ch5A21=>"Let the price of an oblation for sin, the owner whereof is dead, depart hebrew into the salt sea."
lightfoot_ch5A22=>hebrew "The proselyte |Aquila| divided the inheritance with his brother a Gentile, and devoted the use and benefit of it to the salt sea.
lightfoot_ch5A23=>Of three doctors one saith, That he devoted the moneys of idolatry into the salt sea."
lightfoot_ch5A24=>Hence is that allusion, Revelation 20:14, "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire."
lightfoot_ch5A25=>It doth not please me, that Sodom, in the maps, is placed in the northern bounds@N of the Asphaltites;
lightfoot_ch5A26=>when it seems rather to be placed in the southern extremity of it. For,
lightfoot_ch5A27=>|I|. The bounds of the land are thus defined by Moses, Genesis 10:19: "The borders of the Canaanites were from Sidon" (on the north)
lightfoot_ch5A28=>"unto Gaza" (on the south), "as thou |goest| forward, or until thou |comest| to Sodom."
lightfoot_ch5A29=>Are not the bounds here bent from Gaza to the farthest term opposite to it on the east?
lightfoot_ch5A30=>II. Josephus, in the description of the Asphaltites, which we quoted a little above, hath these words:
lightfoot_ch5A31=>"The length of it is five hundred and eighty furlongs : greek and it is stretched out as far as |Zoar| of |Arabia|."
lightfoot_ch5A32=>Note, that the farthest coast of the extension of it southward, is to |Zoar|.
lightfoot_ch5A33=>ut now |Zoar| was not far distant from Sodom, when Lot, with his company, got thither before the rising of the sun, Genesis 19:23.
lightfoot_ch5A34=>"It is written (say the Gemarists), ' The sun was risen upon the earth, when |Lot| entered into Sodom.' -- Now Sodom was four miles from |Zoar|."
lightfoot_ch5A35=>The maps show@V you |Zoar| and |Lot's| Cave in Judea, at the northern coast almost of the Asphaltites: -- by what authority, I do not apprehend.
lightfoot_ch5A36=>The Talmudists, indeed, do mention a certain |Zoar|, which they also call, "The City of Palms."
lightfoot_ch5A37=>-- "There is a story (say they) of some Levites, who travelled to |Zoar|, the city of palms:
lightfoot_ch5A38=>and one of them fell sick, whom they brought to an inn, and there he died."
lightfoot_ch5A39=>But I should sooner believe, that there were two |Zoars|, than I should believe,
lightfoot_ch5A40=>that the father of the Moabites were not conceived and born near |Zoar| of the land of Moab. See Isaiah 15:5.
lightfoot_ch5A41=>Concerning the age@1 of Sodom, when it perished, see the places in the margin@1, and weigh them well.

lightfoot_ch601=>"On the western shore" (of the Asphaltites) "dwell the Essenes;
lightfoot_ch602=>whom persons, guilty of any crimes, fly from on every side.
lightfoot_ch603=>A nation it is that lives alone, and of all other nations in the whole world, most to be admired;
lightfoot_ch604=>they are without any woman; all lust banished, |&c|.
lightfoot_ch605=>Below these, was the town |Engadda|, the next to Jerusalem for fruitfulness,
lightfoot_ch606=>and groves of palm-trees, now another burying-place.
lightfoot_ch607=>From thence stands |Massada|, a castle in a rock@1, and this castle not far from the Asphaltites."
lightfoot_ch608=>|Solinus|, Pliny's shadow, speaks the like things:
lightfoot_ch609=>"The Essenes possess the inner parts of Judea, which look to the west.
lightfoot_ch610=>The town |Engadda| lay beneath the Essenes; but it is now destroyed:
lightfoot_ch611=>but its glory for the famous groves, that are there, doth still endure:
lightfoot_ch612=>and in regard of its most lofty woods of palms, it hath received no disparagement either by age or war.
lightfoot_ch613=>The castle |Massada| is the bounds@N of Judea."
lightfoot_ch614=>We are looking for the places, not the men:
lightfoot_ch615=>-- we might otherwise begin the history of the Essenes from those words,
lightfoot_ch616=>Judges 1:16: "And the sons of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law,
lightfoot_ch617=>went out of the city of palms, with the sons of Judah, into the deserts of Judah."
lightfoot_ch618=>From these we suppose came the |Rechabites|, -- and from their stock, or example, the Essenes.
lightfoot_ch619=>Which if it be true, we make this an argument of the ill placing of |En|-|gedi| in the maps,
lightfoot_ch620=>being set too much towards the north, when it ought to have been placed towards the utmost southern coasts.
lightfoot_ch621=>If the Essenes were the same with the Kenites in seat and place, and the Kenites dwelt beyond |Arad| southward,
lightfoot_ch622=>or indeed even with |Arad|, which is asserted in the text alleged,
lightfoot_ch623=>-- and if below these were |En|-|gedi|, which is also asserted by the authors cited,
lightfoot_ch624=>-- certainly, then, the maps have laid it a long way distant from its own proper place, too much northward.
lightfoot_ch625=>View them, and think of these things. To which we also add this: --
lightfoot_ch626=>The southern borders of the land, Ezekiel 47:19 (the very same which are mentioned Numbers 34 and Joshua 15:2), are thus declared;
lightfoot_ch627=>"The southern coast southward from |Tamar| to the waters of |Meribah| in |Cadesh|," &c.
lightfoot_ch628=>But now |Tamar| and |En|-|gedi| are the same, 2 Chronicles 20:2. Nor have we any reason why we should seek another |Tamar| elsewhere.
lightfoot_ch629=>Certainly, the |Chaldee| paraphrast, and Rabbi |Sol|. |Jarchi|, and |Kimchi| following him, have rendered |Tamar|, in Ezekiel, |Jericho|.
lightfoot_ch630=>But upon what reason ? For how, I beseech you, was it possible, that |Jericho| should be the bounds@N of the south land,
lightfoot_ch631=>when it was the utmost bounds@N of Judea northward?
lightfoot_ch632=>It was this, without all doubt, drove them to that version of the word, because |Jericho| is called the City of Palms,
lightfoot_ch633=>-- and |Tamar| hebrew signifies a palm; since |En|-|gedi| would not give place to |Jericho|, one inch in regard of the glory of palm-groves.
lightfoot_ch634=>Whether |Tadmor|, 1 Kings 9:18, be the same with this our |Tamar|,
lightfoot_ch635=>-- and whether |Tadmor| in the Talmudists be the same with that |Tadmor|,
lightfoot_ch636=>-- we leave to the reader to consider. We produce these few things concerning it, which are related by them
lightfoot_ch637=>-- for the sake of such consideration: --
lightfoot_ch638=>"They receive proselytes from those of |Cardya| and |Tadmor|. Rab. |Abhu|, in the name of R. |Jochanan|,
lightfoot_ch639=>saith, The tradition asserts, that the proselytes of |Tadmor| are fit to enter into the congregation."
lightfoot_ch640=>It was said a little before; "Haggai the prophet taught these three lessons:
lightfoot_ch641=>-- hebrew The rival of a daughter" (of a priest) "may be married by a priest.
lightfoot_ch642=>The Moabites and Ammonites ought to tithe the poor's tithe the seventh year.
lightfoot_ch643=>And the proselytes of |Tadmor| are fit to enter into the congregation."
lightfoot_ch644=>This story is recited, in the Jerusalem |Misna|: hebrew "Mary, of |Tadmor|,
lightfoot_ch645=>having part of the blood sprinkled upon her" (whereby she was to be purified), "heard in that very juncture of time,
lightfoot_ch646=>that her daughter was dead," |&c|. But the Babylonian calls her  hebrew "of |Tarmod|."
lightfoot_ch647=>-- "From the place |Tarmud|," saith the Gloss.
lightfoot_ch648=>-- The '|Tarmudeans|,' hebrew are said, by those of the Babylonian Talmud,
lightfoot_ch649=>to be certain poor people, who got themselves a livelihood by gathering up wood, and selling it.
lightfoot_ch650=>R. |Jochanan| said, "Blessed is he, who shall see the destruction of |Tadmor|:
lightfoot_ch651=>for she communicated in the destruction of the first and second Temple.
lightfoot_ch652=>In the destruction of the first, she brought eighty thousand archers: and so she did, in the destruction of the second."

lightfoot_ch701=>|I|. Of |Kadesh|, or |Rekam|, in the south part, there is no doubt.
lightfoot_ch702=>II. Of it, in the eastern part, there is this mention:
lightfoot_ch703=>"From |Rekam| to the east, and |Rekam| is as the east": that is, R. Nissim interpreting,
lightfoot_ch704=>"|Rekam| itself is reckoned for the east of the world" (that is, for the land of the heathen),
lightfoot_ch705=>"not for the land of Israel." Behold! a |Rekam|, or a |Kadesh|, also, on the east.
lightfoot_ch706=>But the maps have feigned to themselves another |Kadesh|, besides |Barnea|, and this eastern |Rekam|;
lightfoot_ch707=>whither, they think, the people of Israel came in the fortieth year of their travel, Numbers 20.
lightfoot_ch708=>These, we suppose, were some of the reasons, whereby the authors of them were drawn to it.
lightfoot_ch709=>I. Because |Kadesh|-|barnea| was in the desert of |Paran|, Numbers 12:16, 14:1.
lightfoot_ch710=>But the |Kadesh|, whither they came the fortieth year, was in the desert of |Zin|, Numbers 20:1.
lightfoot_ch711=>-- I answer, The searchers@1 of the land, departing from |Kadesh|-|barnea|, are said, also, to go out of the deserts of |Zin|, Number 13:21.
lightfoot_ch712=>|Paran| was the general name of that dreadful desert; |Zin| only one part of it.
lightfoot_ch713=>II. In |Kadesh|-|barnea| they encamped many days, Deuteronomy 1:46.
lightfoot_ch714=>But in that |Kadesh|, concerning which mention is made, Numbers 20, there was not provision sufficient,
lightfoot_ch715=>whereby they might be sustained one day.
lightfoot_ch716=>For they complain, that it was a place altogether destitute of seed, figs, vines, and pomegranates,
lightfoot_ch717=>Numbers 20:5: which they did not at all complain of, while they remained in |Kadesh|-|barnea|.
lightfoot_ch718=>-- I answer, Omitting, that wheresoever they encamped, they were fed by manna;
lightfoot_ch719=>the complaint arose among them, not so much of the place itself, as of the ill boding and prejudice, as I may so say, of the place;
lightfoot_ch720=>because, from the barrenness of this place, they prejudged of the like barrenness of that land, into which they were to enter,
lightfoot_ch721=>-- and the porch, as it were, of which, was |Kadesh|-|barnea|.
lightfoot_ch722=>When they came hither first, now thirty-eight years before,
lightfoot_ch723=>"Ye came to the mountain of the Amorites (saith Moses) which the Lord giveth you," Deuteronomy 1:20,21.
lightfoot_ch724=>" Is it so? " (think they with themselves) " Does the first entrance of the land of promise, promise no better ?
lightfoot_ch725=>There is little hope of the land itself, if the beginnings of it are such. It is convenient, therefore,
lightfoot_ch726=>that we send before us spies, who may bring us word, whether it is of so great account,
lightfoot_ch727=>that we should tire and hazard ourselves by going to that soil, whose first appearance is so horrid and desperate.
lightfoot_ch728=>-- And hence was that unhappy argument before their eyes, by the inducement of which the whole multitude,
lightfoot_ch729=>by so unanimous a vote, concluded and resolved@1 against the land. And since now, after so much time passed,
lightfoot_ch730=>they are come back to the same place, they think, distrust, and complain of the same things.
lightfoot_ch731=>|III|. In |Kadesh|-|barnea|, they had a supply of water; in |Kadesh|, whither they came the fortieth year,
lightfoot_ch732=>there was no water, Numbers 20, etc.
lightfoot_ch733=>-- I answer, They drank, when they first came to |Kadesh|-|barnea|, of the rock, which followed them (1 Cor 10:2),
lightfoot_ch734=>dried up, when they were now ready to enter into the land. If you ask, Why had those rivers that followed them, dried up,
lightfoot_ch735=>as soon as they came at |Kadesh|-|barnea|, which before had not dried up when they came thither;
lightfoot_ch736=>-- then I ask also, Why had they dried up, when they came to another |Kadesh| ?
lightfoot_ch737=>|IV.| Concerning the |Kadesh|, whither they came the last year of their travel,
lightfoot_ch738=>it is said, that the city was in the utmost bounds@N of the land of Edom :
lightfoot_ch739=>and therefore, they desire leave of the king to pass through the land of Edom, Numbers 20:16,17.
lightfoot_ch740=>-- I answer, Nothing at all hinders, but these things may be spoke of |Kadesh|-|barnea|,
lightfoot_ch741=>which lying contiguous to the mountain of the Amorites, that is, to mountainous Judea, showed so great an army an access,
lightfoot_ch742=>and promised it; only that access was winding, and very difficult to be passed.
lightfoot_ch743=>They desire, therefore, a more level way of the king of Edom, but obtain it not.
lightfoot_ch744=>V. Perhaps that which chiefly moved them, was this; that supposing one |Kadesh| only, to wit, |Barnea|,
lightfoot_ch745=>-- it will be scarce possible not to confound the encampings of Israel in the wilderness, and their movings from place to place.
lightfoot_ch746=>-- I answer, There will be the same easiness of ordering them,
lightfoot_ch747=>if you do but reduce the sixth and seventh verses of Deuteronomy 10, into a true sense,
lightfoot_ch748=>and into agreement with Numbers 33 from verses 31 to 41;
lightfoot_ch749=>which is not hard to do. But let these things suffice, for the present, to have spoke besides our scope.
lightfoot_ch750=>That that |Kadesh|, to which they came in the fortieth year (which is called |Meribah|, Numbers 20:13),
lightfoot_ch751=>is the same with |Kadesh|-|barnea|, is clear enough from hence,
lightfoot_ch752=>-- that |Meribah| in |Kadesh| is assigned for the southern border of the land, Ezekiel 47:19;
lightfoot_ch753=>which border of old was |Kadesh|-|barnea|, Numbers 34:4; Joshua 15:3.

lightfoot_ch801=>Pliny writes, "From |Pelusium| are the intrenchments of |Chabrias| : mount |Casius| :
lightfoot_ch802=>the temple of |Jupiter| |Casius| : the tomb of |Pompey| the Great: |Ostracine|:
lightfoot_ch803=>Arabia is bounded sixty-five miles from |Pelusium|:
lightfoot_ch804=>soon after begins Idumea and Palestine from the rising up of the |Sirbon| lake.
lightfoot_ch805=>" Either my eyes deceive me, while I read these things,
lightfoot_ch806=>-- or mount |Casius| lies nearer |Pelusium|, than the lake of |Sirbon|.
lightfoot_ch807=>The maps have ill placed the |Sirbon| between mount |Casius| and |Pelusium|.
lightfoot_ch808=>|Sirbon| implies burning; the name of the lake being derived from its nature, which is fiery and bituminous.
lightfoot_ch809=>It is described by |Diodorus| |Siculus|, Strabo, and others, whom you may look upon.
lightfoot_ch810=>A lake like to that of Sodom, and perhaps was of the like fate and original;
lightfoot_ch811=>to wit, an example of divine indignation.
lightfoot_ch812=>What if it be the monument of that dreadful earthquake in the days of |Uzziah|,
lightfoot_ch813=>Amos 1:1, Zechariah 14:5 ? when God contended also in fire, Amos 7:4:
lightfoot_ch814=>so that some cities perished after the manner of Sodom and Gomorrha, Amos 4:11; Isaiah 1:9.
lightfoot_ch815=>The farthest border of the land of Israel southward is not Nile in Egypt, but |Shihor| in the way to Egypt,
lightfoot_ch816=>Joshua 13:3; Jeremiah 2:18. In the Seventy interpreters, it is |Rhinocorura|;
lightfoot_ch817=>for they render that in Isaiah 27:12, "unto the stream of Egypt." "Unto |Rhinocorura|."
lightfoot_ch818=>Of which place and name, derived from the "cutting of nostrils", see |Diodorus| |Siculus|, lib.1. [60.]


lightfoot_ch900=>a sight of Judea
lightfoot_ch901=>"In Judea is the mountainous country, the plain, and the vale. What is the mountainous country of Judea?
lightfoot_ch902=>It is the king's mountain. The plain of it is the plain of the south. The vale is from |En|-|gedi| to Jericho.
lightfoot_ch903=>The plain of |Lydda| is as the plain of the south: and its mountainous country is as the king's mountainous country.
lightfoot_ch904=>From |Beth|-|horon| to the sea is one circumjacent region. Rabbi |Jochanan| saith, Yet it hath a mountainous part, a plain, and a vale.
lightfoot_ch905=>From |Beth|-|horon| to |Emmaus| is mountainous, -- from |Emmaus| to Lydda is plain, -- from Lydda to the sea is valley."
lightfoot_ch906=>Judea is not divided amiss into four parts: -- namely, into the country, which formerly was the Philistines,
lightfoot_ch907=>which takes up the western part. To this joins, on the east, the mountainous country of Judea,
lightfoot_ch908=>which is also called "The king's mount." To the mountainous country, on the east, joins a plain,
lightfoot_ch909=>a country more low and level than the mountains, which nevertheless here and there hath its hills...
lightfoot_ch910=>"A valley, lying between mountains, is reckoned with the mountains, and mountains in a valley are numbered with the valley."
lightfoot_ch911=>To the plain eastwardly joins a valley, lower than the plain, -- namely, the coast of the sea of Sodom, and at length of Jordan.
lightfoot_ch912=>The land of Benjamin, in like manner, which is numbered with Judea, in respect of its superficies, was of the same nature;
lightfoot_ch913=>which, although "it was a portion of the narrowest limits, by reason of the goodness of the soil," yet had its mountainous part,
lightfoot_ch914=>its plain, and vale: and that, not only towards Lydda, and the great sea, but towards Jericho and Jordan.
lightfoot_ch915=>Judea did excel all the other parts of the land of Israel in very many privileges.
lightfoot_ch916=>For, besides that in it was seated Jerusalem, the metropolis of the whole nation, and in Jerusalem stood the Temple,
lightfoot_ch917=>and in the Temple sat the Sanhedrim: -- this was also peculiar to it out of the Canons,
lightfoot_ch918=>that "it was not lawful to intercalate the year out of Judea, while they might do it in Judea."
lightfoot_ch919=>|Maimonides| gives the reason of the thing, "Because there dwelt the divine glory." --
lightfoot_ch920=>"Nor was the sheaf of the first-fruits of the barley to be fetched elsewhere, than from Judea, and as near as might be to Jerusalem."
lightfoot_ch921=>Once it was fetched a great way off, &c.

lightfoot_ch1001=>"Idumea and Palestine begin from the rising up of the |Sirbon| lake. The towns of |Rhinocorura|, and within |Raphea|.
lightfoot_ch1002=>Gaza, and within |Anthedon|. Mount |Angaris|. The country along the coast, Samaria. The free town |Ascalon|, |Azotus|.
lightfoot_ch1003=>The two |Jamnes|, the one a village" (otherwise |Jamne| within). "|Joppe| of the Phoenicians. Thence |Apollonia|.
lightfoot_ch1004=>The tower of |Strato|; the same is Caesarea. The bounds of Palestine are a hundred and eighty-nine miles from the confines of Arabia.
lightfoot_ch1005=>Then begins Phoenice."
lightfoot_ch1006=>And chapter 19: "We must go back to the coast, and Phoenice. There was the town |Crocodilon|; it is now a river.
lightfoot_ch1007=>Rains@V of some cities. |Dorum|. |Sycaminum|. The promontory Carmel: and, in the mountain, a town of the same name,
lightfoot_ch1008=>heretofore called |Ecbatana|. Near that, |Getta|, |Lebba|, the river |Pagida| or |Belus|, mingling glassy sand with its small shore: it flows from the lake |Cendevia|, at the root@N of Carmel.
lightfoot_ch1009=>Next that is |Ptolemais|, a colony of |Claudius| |Caesar|, which heretofore was called |Ace|. The town |Ecdippa|. The White Promontory. Tyrus, heretofore an island, &c.
lightfoot_ch1010=>It is in compass nineteen miles, |Palae|-|Tyre|, lying within, being included. The town itself contains two-and-twenty furlongs.
lightfoot_ch1011=>Then the towns, |Enhydra|, |Sarepta|, and |Ornithon|; and Sidon, the artist of glass, and the mother of Thebes in |Boeotia|."
lightfoot_ch1012=>Strabo goes backward : "Tyrus is not distant from Sidon above two hundred furlongs": -- five-and-twenty miles.
lightfoot_ch1013=>The masters of the Jews have observed this neighbourhood in that canon, whereby provision is made,
lightfoot_ch1014=>that nobody betake himself to sail in the Mediterranean sea within three days before the sabbath:
lightfoot_ch1015=>"But if any (say they) will sail from Tyre to Sidon, he may, even on the eve of the sabbath: because it is well known,
lightfoot_ch1016=>that that space may be sailed, while it is yet day."
lightfoot_ch1017=>"Between Tyre and Sidon there is the little city |Ornithon|" (the city of birds). "At Tyre a river goes out."
lightfoot_ch1018=>"Thirty furlongs beyond Tyre is |Palae|-|Tyrus|": three miles three quarters.
lightfoot_ch1019=>When, therefore, Pliny saith, the compass of Tyre is nineteen miles, "|Palae|-Tyre, that lies within, being included,"
lightfoot_ch1020=>he shows manifestly, that it is not to be understood of the compass of the city itself, since he saith,
lightfoot_ch1021=>"The town itself held two-and-twenty furlongs": nor can it well be taken of the whole circumference of the |Tyrian| jurisdiction,
lightfoot_ch1022=>but rather of the extent of the bounds of it that way, which he went.
lightfoot_ch1023=>"Moreover, from Tyre" (southward) "is |Ptolemais|, formerly called |Ace|. And between |Ace| and Tyre, is a shore heaped with sands fit to make glass."
lightfoot_ch1024=>"Beyond |Ace| is the tower of |Strato|. The mountain Carmel lies between: and the names of some small cities,
lightfoot_ch1025=>and nothing more. The cities of |Sycamines|, of Herdsmen, of |Crocodiles|, and others.
lightfoot_ch1026=>And going thence, is a certain great wood."
lightfoot_ch1027=>"After that, |Joppa|; next which, the shore of Egypt, which before had stretched out towards sun-rising,
lightfoot_ch1028=>does remarkably bend towards the north. There some talk, that |Andromeda| was exposed to the whale.
lightfoot_ch1029=>A place sufficiently high; so high, indeed, that from thence (they report) Jerusalem may be seen,
lightfoot_ch1030=>the metropolis of the Jews. The Jews, also, that go down to the sea, use this port. But these ports are receptacles@1 for robbers. And so was the wood and Carmel."
lightfoot_ch1031=>"And this place was so well peopled, that, out of |Jamnia|, a near village, and the dwellings neighbouring about, might be armed forty thousand men."
lightfoot_ch1032=>"Thence to mount |Casius| towards |Pelusium|, the distance is a thousand furlongs, and a little more. And three hundred more to |Pelusium|."
lightfoot_ch1033=>Here we must stop, and see how these two authors do agree. For, according to Strabo's account, one thousand three hundred furlongs, and a little more, run out from |Pelusium| to |Joppa|:
lightfoot_ch1034=>that is, one hundred and sixty three miles, or thereabouts:
lightfoot_ch1035=>but according to Pliny's, at first sight, more by far. For "Arabia (saith he) is bounded sixty-five miles from |Pelusium|:
lightfoot_ch1036=>and the end of Palestine is one hundred and eighty-nine miles from the confines of Arabia. And then begins Phoenice."
lightfoot_ch1037=>The sum is two hundred and fifty-four miles. He had named Joppa before, "Joppa of the Phoenicians."
lightfoot_ch1038=>But now, supposing he makes Joppa the border of Palestine, and the beginning of Phoenice, there are from |Pelusium| to Joppa, himself reckoning, almost a hundred miles more than in Strabo.
lightfoot_ch1039=>Nor is there any thing to answer from the difference of the measure of Strabo's furlongs, and Pliny's miles.
lightfoot_ch1040=>For they go by the same measure, themselves being witnesses: for to Strabo, "Eight furlongs make a mile";
lightfoot_ch1041=>and, to Pliny, "A furlong makes a hundred and twenty-five of our paces": -- which comes to the same thing.
lightfoot_ch1042=>We must therefore say, that by the "end of Palestine," in Pliny, is properly signified the end of it, touching upon Phoenicia properly so called; -- that is, upon the borders of Tyre and Sidon.
lightfoot_ch1043=>For when he calls Joppa, "Joppa of the Phoenicians," -- he does not conclude Joppa within Phoenicia;
lightfoot_ch1044=>but because the sea, washing upon that shore of Palestine, was divided in common speech into the Phoenician and the Egyptian sea (so Strabo before, "Afterward Joppa;
lightfoot_ch1045=>after that, the shore of Egypt," &c.); and because the Phoenicians were famous for navigation,
lightfoot_ch1046=>-- he ascribed their name to Joppa, a very eminent haven of that shore. But he stretched the borders of Palestine a great way farther;
lightfoot_ch1047=>-- namely, so far till they meet with the borders of Tyre and Sidon. So far, therefore, doth Pliny's measure@N extend itself;
lightfoot_ch1048=>to wit, -- that, from Idumea, and the rising of the |Sirbon| lake, to the borders of Tyre and Sidon, there be one hundred and eighty-nine miles.
lightfoot_ch1049=>The place that divided these meeting-bounds to the Jews, was |Acon|, or |Ptolemais|;
lightfoot_ch1050=>which we shall note, when we come thither: -- but whether it was so to Pliny, remains obscure.
lightfoot_ch1051=>But it is a more probable opinion, that he computed according to the vulgar and most known distinction.
lightfoot_ch1052=>|Gulielmus| |Tyrius|, measuring the borders of the Tyre of his time southward, extends them to four or five miles: "For it is extended southward towards |Ptolemais|,
lightfoot_ch1053=>as far as to that place, which, at this day, is called "the district of |Scandarion|," which is four or five miles."
lightfoot_ch1054=>If, therefore, it should be granted, that Pliny's measure extended so far,
lightfoot_ch1055=>we might compute the length of the land from the |Sirbon|, where also is the river of Egypt, to Sidon, by this account:
lightfoot_ch1056=>I. From the |Sirbon| to the borders of Phoenice, one hundred and eighty-nine miles. -- Pliny.
lightfoot_ch1057=>II. From the first borders of Phoenice to Tyre, five miles. -- |Gul|. |Tyrius|.
lightfoot_ch1058=>III. From Tyre to Sidon, twenty-five miles. -- Strabo.
lightfoot_ch1059=>Sum total is two hundred and nineteen miles.

lightfoot_ch1100=>A Chorographical Century
lightfoot_ch1101=>The Mountainous Country of Judea.
lightfoot_ch1102=>"What is the mountainous country of Judea? It is the king's mountain."
lightfoot_ch1103=>However Judea, here and there, doth swell out much with mountains, yet its chief swelling appears in that broad back of mountains,
lightfoot_ch1104=>that runs from the utmost southern cost as far as Hebron, and almost as Jerusalem itself.
lightfoot_ch1105=>Which the Holy Scripture called "The hill-country of Judah," Joshua 21:11; Luke 1:39.
lightfoot_ch1106=>Unless I am very much mistaken, -- the maps of |Adricomus|, |Tirinius|, and others, ought to be corrected,
lightfoot_ch1107=>which have feigned to themselves a very long back of mountains, beginning almost at the Red Sea, and reaching almost to the land of Canaan,
lightfoot_ch1108=>and that with this inscription, "The |Amorrhean| Mountain."
lightfoot_ch1109=>Those authors are mistaken by an ill interpretation of [a] phrase rendering it, "in the way by" (or near) "the mountain of the Amorites,"
lightfoot_ch1110=>-- when it should be rendered, "in the way to the mountain of the Amorites."
lightfoot_ch1111=>Let the reader consult Deuteronomy 1:19,20: "We departed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible desert, which ye saw,
lightfoot_ch1112=>in the way leading to the mountain of the Amorite, as our Lord commanded us, and came to Cadesh-barnea.
lightfoot_ch1113=>Then I said unto you, You are now come to the mountain of the Amorites," &c.
lightfoot_ch1114=>The mountain of the Amorites took its beginning from Cadesh-barnea, the southern border, of the land of Israel,
lightfoot_ch1115=>-- and, by a hardened gibbosity, thrust forward itself into Judea beyond Hebron, the name only being changed into the "Hill-country of Judea."
lightfoot_ch1116=>Whence is that of Samson to be understood, that he carried not the gates of Gaza near to Hebron, or to the mountain, whence Hebron might be seen;
lightfoot_ch1117=>-- but to the top of this mountainous country, which runs out to Hebron: -- and so are the words to be rendered,
lightfoot_ch1118=>Judges 16:3, "He carried them to the top of a mountainous place, which is before Hebron."
lightfoot_ch1119=>This mountainous country is called "The mountainous desert," Psalm 75:6, because it is not from the east, nor from the west,
lightfoot_ch1120=>nor from the desert of the mountains. Where the Targum thus; "Nor from the south, the mountainous place."
lightfoot_ch1121=>It remains doubtful, why it is called by the Talmudists "The King's mountain."
lightfoot_ch1122=>Whether because it was king among all the other mountains of Judea? or, because the royal dignity of David's house sprang hence,
lightfoot_ch1123=>-- to wit, from Hebron ? There is much mention of it in the Jewish writers.
lightfoot_ch1124=>The |Chaldee| paraphrast upon Judges 4:5: "Deborah had white dust in the King's Mountain."
lightfoot_ch1125=>That is, as it seems, potter's clay: for the Gemarists, speaking somewhere concerning potters say,
lightfoot_ch1126=>"That they work in black dust, or in white dust."
lightfoot_ch1127=>"In the days of R. Hoshaia, some went about to get a freedom from some tithes for the Mount of the King."
lightfoot_ch1128=>Rabbi Simeon had vinedressers in the Mount of the King. He was minded to let out his vineyard to heathens.
lightfoot_ch1129=>R. Chaijah, R. Issai, and R. Immai, went up to the King's Mountain. They saw a certain heathen, who was suspicious concerning their wine.
lightfoot_ch1130=>A myriad of cities stood in the Mountain-royal, of which R. Eliezer Ben Harsum possessed a thousand.
lightfoot_ch1131=>This mountainous country is not, therefore, called "The mountainous desert," because it was void of cities and towns,
lightfoot_ch1132=>but because it was a more barren and rough country.
lightfoot_ch1133=>"The Royal Mountain was laid waste by reason of a cock and a hen. It was the custom, when they brought forth the bridegroom and the bride,
lightfoot_ch1134=>to lead before them a cock and a hen: as if they should say, Increase and multiply, as they.
lightfoot_ch1135=>On a certain day a regiment of Romans passed by, and wrested the cock and the hen from them:
lightfoot_ch1136=>these, therefore, rose up against them, and beat them. Away, therefore, they go to Caesar, and told him, The Jews rebel against thee, &c.
lightfoot_ch1137=>R. |Asai| saith, Three hundred thousand drew@1 sword, and went up to the Royal Mountain, and there slew for three days and three nights," &c.
lightfoot_ch1138=>Rabbi |Asai| saith, "|Janneus| the king had sixty myriads of cities in the Royal Mountain: and in each the number was equal to them,
lightfoot_ch1139=>that went out of Egypt, -- excepting three cities, in which that number was doubted. And these were,
lightfoot_ch1140=>I. |Caphar| |Bish| (that is, the Ill Town); therefore called so because it afforded not a house of hospitality.
lightfoot_ch1141=>II. [A town,] that had its name from a certain herb, because by that herb they were nourished.
lightfoot_ch1142=>III. The town of males; so called, saith R. Jochanan, because their wives first brought forth males, and then females, and so left off."
lightfoot_ch1143=>This story is recited by the Jerusalem Talmudists, who say the town of males is so called, because,
lightfoot_ch1144=>unless the women departed thence somewhere else, they could not bring forth male children.
lightfoot_ch1145=>"But (saith Ulla) I saw that place, and it is not able to contain even sixty myriads of nests.
lightfoot_ch1146=>Therefore, said a certain sectary of R. |Chaninah|, Ye lie, ye lie.
lightfoot_ch1147=>To whom he replied, That land is called "the land of a Kid": but now "a kid" hath a skin, that does not contain his flesh:
lightfoot_ch1148=>so the land of Israel, while it is inhabited, is spacious; but, when uninhabited, more contracted."

lightfoot_ch1200=>The South Country. Judea Called "the South," in Respect of Galilee.
lightfoot_ch1201=>|Rabban| |Gamaliel|, and the elders sitting together at the ascent into the gallery, in the mount of the Temple, had |Jochanan|,
lightfoot_ch1202=>the priest, and the amanuensis, sitting with them.
lightfoot_ch1203=>They said to him, "Go to, write to our brethren, the inhabitants of Upper Galilee, and Nether Galilee, health:
lightfoot_ch1204=>we certify you, that the time is come of separating the tithes.
lightfoot_ch1205=>And to our brethren, that inhabit the Upper South Country, and that inhabit the Nether South Country, health: we certify you," &c.
lightfoot_ch1206=>The "Upper South country" consisted of that part of the country, which was hilly;
lightfoot_ch1207=>the "Nether," of a plain, and valley sinking on both sides. Which country, although it were barren above all other parts of the land,
lightfoot_ch1208=>yet had its inhabitants, and those many, as well as other countries of the land.
lightfoot_ch1209=>He that turns over the Talmudical books, will meet very frequently with the name of the "South," taken for "whole Judea" in opposition to "Galilee."
lightfoot_ch1210=>"Those of |Zippor| enjoined a fast to obtain rain@N, but the rain@N came not down.
lightfoot_ch1211=>Therefore, said they of |Zippor|, R. Joshua |Ben| |Levi| obtained rain@N for the southern people:
lightfoot_ch1212=>but R. |Chaninah| hinders it from coming upon the people of |Zippor|.
lightfoot_ch1213=>They were called, therefore, together to a second fast. R. Chaninah sent to fetch R. Joshua Ben Levi.
lightfoot_ch1214=>And both went out to the fast, and yet rain@N fell not.
lightfoot_ch1215=>He stood forth, therefore, and said before them, Neither doth Joshua Ben Levi obtain rain@N for the southern people,
lightfoot_ch1216=>nor does R. |Chaninah| restrain it from the people of |Zippor|:
lightfoot_ch1217=>but the southern people have a soft heart, to hear the words of the law and be humbled: but the people of |Zippor| have a hard heart."
lightfoot_ch1218=>But now R. Joshua Ben Levi, who was called "the southern," was of Lydda: and those southern people,
lightfoot_ch1219=>for whom he obtained rain@N, were of Lydda, and such as dwelt in that country.
lightfoot_ch1220=>"A devout disciple learned the intercalation of the year before his master, three years and a half:
lightfoot_ch1221=>he came, and intercalated for Galilee: but he could not intercalate for the south," that is, for Judea
lightfoot_ch1222=>Hence you may understand, in what sense some Rabbins are called southern: as "R. Jacob of the south"..."R. Samlai of the south";
lightfoot_ch1223=>whom you have disputing with certain, whom the Gemarists call heretics: whom I think rather to have been "Christians."
lightfoot_ch1224=>And it seems to be the disputation of a Christian purposed to assert a trinity of persons in the Deity, but nevertheless a unity of the Deity.
lightfoot_ch1225=>After you have heard the matter, perhaps you will be of my judgment. View the place.

lightfoot_ch1301=>After very many histories of this place in the Holy Bible, which there is no need to repeat here,
lightfoot_ch1302=>-- in this city did |Alexander| the Great, at length, besiege |Babemeses| the |Persian|, by the space of two months.
lightfoot_ch1303=>"And that city, which before-time was most famous, was laid waste by him, and rendered desert."
lightfoot_ch1304=>Not that he had destroyed the building of the city, or consumed it with fire;
lightfoot_ch1305=>for presently after his death, |Antigonus| and |Ptolemy|, his captains, fighting, it had walls, gates, and fortifications:
lightfoot_ch1306=>but that he divested it of its ancient glory, so that it was at last melted into a new city of that name
lightfoot_ch1307=>built nearer the sea, where formerly had been "the haven of the |Gazaeans|." That is called by |Diodorus|, "old Gaza";
lightfoot_ch1308=>and "Gaza desert," by Strabo, and the New Testament, Acts 8:26.
lightfoot_ch1309=>At last it was called "New |Maijuma|," and after that "|Constantia|":
lightfoot_ch1310=>-- concerning which, see Eusebius, of "the Life of Constantine," book iv. chap.28;
lightfoot_ch1311=>and Sozomen's "Ecclesiastical History," book v. chap.3...
lightfoot_ch1312=>There is mentioned the "mart of Gaza," one of the three more famed marts,
lightfoot_ch1313=>-- to wit, that of Gaza, and of |Aco|, and of |Botna|.

lightfoot_ch1401=>"|Ascalon|," in the Samaritan interpreter, is the same with "|Gerar|," Genesis 21.
lightfoot_ch1402=>The word |Gerar|, among the Talmudists, seems to have passed into "|Gerariku|."
lightfoot_ch1403=>"Wherefore (say they) have they not determined of that country, which is in |Gerariku| ?
lightfoot_ch1404=>Because it is ill to dwell in. How far? To the river of Egypt. But behold, Gaza is pleasant to dwell in," &c.
lightfoot_ch1405=>In the author of |Aruch| it is, |Gardiki|. "|Bereshith| |Rabbah| (saith he) renders |Gardiki|."
lightfoot_ch1406=>"The king of |Gerar|," Genesis 20:2, with the Jerusalem Targumist, is "The king of |Arad|."
lightfoot_ch1407=>Note the affinity of |Arad|, |Gerar|, and |Ascalon|; and thence, unless I am deceived, will grow some light,
lightfoot_ch1408=>to illustrate those places in the Holy Bible, where we meet with these names.
lightfoot_ch1409=>Ascalon was distant from Jerusalem five hundred and twenty furlongs: that is, sixty-five miles.
lightfoot_ch1410=>Which is to be understood of the older Ascalon. For Benjamin |Tudelensis| makes mention of a double Ascalon,
lightfoot_ch1411=>-- (this our) old, and the new. For thus he writes:
lightfoot_ch1412=>"Then" (from |Azotus|) "is new Ascalon distant two |parsae|, or leagues@1" (that is, eight miles);
lightfoot_ch1413=>"which Ezra, the priest, of blessed memory, built at the seashore...
lightfoot_ch1414=>now that is distant from old Ascalon, now destroyed, four leagues."
lightfoot_ch1415=>So that, from |Azotus| to Ascalon, of which we are speaking, and of which alone the Holy Scripture speaks,
lightfoot_ch1416=>were, by his computation, four-and-twenty miles;
lightfoot_ch1417=>and by the computation of |Adrichomius|, two hundred furlongs, that is, five-and-twenty miles.
lightfoot_ch1418=>"Ten miles from Gaza" (says our countryman |Sandes| |[Sandys]|, an eyewitness),
lightfoot_ch1419=>"and near the sea, is placed Ascalon, now of no note,
lightfoot_ch1420=>anciently a venerable place to the heathen for the temple of |Dagon|, and the festivals of |Semiramis| birthday."
lightfoot_ch1421=>From Gaza to |Azotus|, |Diodorus| |Siculus| being witness, are two-hundred and seventy furlongs:
lightfoot_ch1422=>which amount to four-and-thirty miles: namely, from Gaza to Ascalon, ten miles, and thence to |Azotus| four-and-twenty.
lightfoot_ch1423=>That is a common saying, "From Ascalon onward to the south, is the heathen country,
lightfoot_ch1424=>and Ascalon itself is reputed for a heathen country." And yet something of Ascalon was within the land of Israel.
lightfoot_ch1425=>The apple-gardens or orchards, did bound the land of Ascalon on that coast, which we have observed before.
lightfoot_ch1426=>And yet, "when R. Ismael Ben R. Josi, and Ben Hakkaphar, were set over the space of Ascalon"
lightfoot_ch1427=>(that is, when it was intrusted to them to judge concerning the spaces or parts of Ascalon,
lightfoot_ch1428=>-- namely, what were within the land, and what without, &c.)
lightfoot_ch1429=>"They pronounced it clean from the authority of R. Phinchasi Ben Jair,
lightfoot_ch1430=>who said, We went down to the corn@1-market of Ascalon, and thence we received wheat,
lightfoot_ch1431=>and going up into our city we washed, and ate our |Thruma|";
lightfoot_ch1432=>i.e. The portion of first-fruits belonging to the priests.
lightfoot_ch1433=>The greatest part of the city, if not the whole, was esteemed, under the second Temple,
lightfoot_ch1434=>to be without the limits of the land: but some part, or at least the apple-yards@1,
lightfoot_ch1435=>and the places next adjacent, were within the land.
lightfoot_ch1436=>Mention is made of a certain temple in Ascalon among the "five more famous temples,
lightfoot_ch1437=>-- viz. the temple of |Bel| in Babylon, the temple of |Nebo| in |Cursi|,
lightfoot_ch1438=>of |Tiratha| in |Mapheg|, of |Zeripha| in Ascalon, and of |Nishra| in Arabia."
lightfoot_ch1439=>And there is a story of a fast enjoined, because some sign appeared of a blast of the corn@1 in Ascalon:
lightfoot_ch1440=>"The elders went down from Jerusalem into their cities, and enjoined a fast,
lightfoot_ch1441=>because so much of a blast was seen in Ascalon as the space of the mouth of an oven may contain."
lightfoot_ch1442=>But most famous of all is the story of the eighty women, that were witches,
lightfoot_ch1443=>hanged by Simeon Ben Shetach in one and the same day.
lightfoot_ch1444=>We will not think much to relate the thing in the words of the Gemarists:
lightfoot_ch1445=>-- "When as two disciples of the wise men in Ascalon were intent upon the study of the law,
lightfoot_ch1446=>one of them, at length dying, had no funerals performed for him, -- when yet a publican, dying at that time, had.
lightfoot_ch1447=>To the student, that survived, are revealed the joys of his saved companion, and likewise the punishments of the damned publican."
lightfoot_ch1448=>Let the learned reader turn this clause into English; unless my conjecture fail@1 me, it savours of spite and poison.
lightfoot_ch1449=>I should thus render it: "He saw Mary, the daughter of |Eli|, in the shades, hung up by the kernels of the breasts;
lightfoot_ch1450=>and when he inquired, How long she was to suffer those things?
lightfoot_ch1451=>it was answered, Until Simon |Ben| |Shetach| came to supply her place.
lightfoot_ch1452=>But, said he, for what crime? It is answered, Therefore, because he sometime swore against his soul, and said,
lightfoot_ch1453=>If I shall ever become a prince, I will destroy all wizards.
lightfoot_ch1454=>But behold, he is become a prince, and yet he hath not done this:
lightfoot_ch1455=>for eighty women, that are witches, lie hid in a cave at Ascalon, and kill the world.
lightfoot_ch1456=>Go, and tell him, &c. He went to him, therefore, and related these things, &c.
lightfoot_ch1457=>On a certain rainy day, therefore, having eighty young men in company with him,
lightfoot_ch1458=>he goes to the cave, knocks, professes himself one of the bewitching society, and is let in.
lightfoot_ch1459=>He sees them exercising their art. For, muttering certain words together, one brings morsels of meat,
lightfoot_ch1460=>-- another, wine, -- another, boiled flesh, &c. But what can you do, say they?
lightfoot_ch1461=>Saith he, I will twice utter my voice, and I will bring in eighty youths handsomely habited,
lightfoot_ch1462=>themselves merry, and shall make you so. They say to him, Such we would have.
lightfoot_ch1463=>He utters his voice the first time, and the young men put on their clean clothes"
lightfoot_ch1464=>(free from the rains, for they had carried them with them covered and safe in certain vessels for the same purpose).
lightfoot_ch1465=>"Crying out the second time, in they all come: and a sign being given,
lightfoot_ch1466=>that each man should lift up from the earth one woman (for so their magical power would perish),
lightfoot_ch1467=>he said to her which had brought the morsels, Bring hither now the morsels; but she brought them not.
lightfoot_ch1468=>Therefore, said he, Carry her away to the gallows. Bring wine, but she brought it not;
lightfoot_ch1469=>Carry her also away, saith he, to hanging@N. And so it was done with them all.
lightfoot_ch1470=>Hence is the tradition, |Simeon| |Ben| |Shetach| hung eighty women in Ascalon.
lightfoot_ch1471=>But they do not judge two persons in the same day: but this he did out of the necessity of the time."
lightfoot_ch1472=>Where the Gloss@1 thus; "He was compelled to do this,
lightfoot_ch1473=>because the women of Israel had very much broke out into witchcraft.
lightfoot_ch1474=>Therefore, he made a hedge to the time, and hanged them, to expose the thing publicly.
lightfoot_ch1475=>And this in one and the same day, that their kindred might no way conspire to deliver them."

lightfoot_ch1501=>|Jabneh|. |Jamnia|.
lightfoot_ch1502=>...Pliny doth dispose the towns here in this order;
lightfoot_ch1503=>-- "|Azotus|, the two |Jamnes|, |Joppe|." -- R. Benjamin, in the order backward, thus,
lightfoot_ch1504=>-- "|Joppah|, |Jabneh|, |Azotus|." That is |Jabneh| with this author, that is |Jaminia| with the other.
lightfoot_ch1505=>A remembrance of this place is in 2 Chronicles 26:6: but the chief fame of it is for the Sanhedrim,
lightfoot_ch1506=>that was placed there, both before the destruction of Jerusalem and after.
lightfoot_ch1507=>Rabban Gamaliel, St. Paul's master, first presided there.
lightfoot_ch1508=>Under whom came forth that cursed form of prayer, which they called "The prayer against heretics,"
lightfoot_ch1509=>composed by Samuel the Little, who died before the destruction of the city.
lightfoot_ch1510=>Gamaliel died eighteen years before the Temple was destroyed;
lightfoot_ch1511=>and his son Rabban Simeon succeeded him, who perished with the city.
lightfoot_ch1512=>Jerusalem being destroyed, Rabban Jochanan Ben Zaccai obtained of Titus the conqueror,
lightfoot_ch1513=>that he might still receive and retain the Sanhedrim of |Jabneh|:
lightfoot_ch1514=>which being granted by him, Jochanan himself was first president there; and after him,
lightfoot_ch1515=>Rabban Gamaliel the second: and after him, R. Akibah.
lightfoot_ch1516=>And this place was famous above all the other universities, except only the latest of all,
lightfoot_ch1517=>-- viz. Tiberias: so that "The vineyard of |Jabneh|" became a proverb.
lightfoot_ch1518=>"For there they sat in order, as a vineyard." And it is reported,
lightfoot_ch1519=>"that there were there three hundred classes of scholars, -- or, at least, eighty."
lightfoot_ch1520=>How long time Rabban Jochanan sat here, is doubted.
lightfoot_ch1521=>There are some, who attribute to him two years only; and others five: with whom we consent.
lightfoot_ch1522=>This Rabban Jochanan I very much suspect to be the same with that John, mentioned Acts 4:6.
lightfoot_ch1523=>Omitting those things, which were done by him, while he remained at Jabneh,
lightfoot_ch1524=>-- let me produce his dying words, as they are recited by his friends:
lightfoot_ch1525=>"When Rabban Jochanan Ben Zaccai now lay languishing, his scholars came to visit him:
lightfoot_ch1526=>whom he seeing began to weep. To whom they said, 'O thou light of Israel, thou right-hand pillar,
lightfoot_ch1527=>thou strong hammer, whence are those tears ?"
lightfoot_ch1528=>To whom he replied, " If men were about to carry me before a king of flesh and blood,
lightfoot_ch1529=>who today is here, and tomorrow is in his grave, -- if he were angry with me, his anger is not everlasting;
lightfoot_ch1530=>if he should cast me into bonds, his bonds are not eternal;
lightfoot_ch1531=>if he should kill me, his killing would not be eternal:
lightfoot_ch1532=>and I might perhaps pacify him with words, or soften him with a gift.
lightfoot_ch1533=>But they are ready to lead me before the King of kings, the Lord, holy and blessed,
lightfoot_ch1534=>who lives and lasts for ever, and for ever and ever; who if he be angry with me, his anger is eternal;
lightfoot_ch1535=>if he bind me, his bond is eternal; if he kill me, his killing is eternal;
lightfoot_ch1536=>and whom I cannot either appease with words, or soften with a gift.
lightfoot_ch1537=>And moreover, there are two ways before me, one to paradise, another to hell;
lightfoot_ch1538=>and I know not which way they will lead me. Should I not therefore weep? " Ah!
lightfoot_ch1539=>the miserable and fainting confidence of a Pharisee in death!
lightfoot_ch1540=>Rabban Gamaliel of Jabneh, a busy and severe man, succeeded Jochanan.
lightfoot_ch1541=>Being to be slain with his father, Rabban Simeon, -- by the intercession of Rabban Jochanan he was delivered.
lightfoot_ch1542=>Being also sought for to be slain, when |Turnus| |Rufus| (in Josephus, |Terentius| |Rufus|) ploughed up the floor of the Temple,
lightfoot_ch1543=>he was delivered by a way scarcely credible. Sitting in Jabneh he removed R. Akibah,
lightfoot_ch1544=>head at that time of the school of Lydda, from his headship;
lightfoot_ch1545=>and he at last was removed from his, and over him was placed R. Eleazar Ben Azarias.
lightfoot_ch1546=>R. Akibah succeeded him, and sat forty years, and died a fool, being deceived by Ben Cozba,
lightfoot_ch1547=>and slain with him: and the university was removed from Jabneh to |Usha|.
lightfoot_ch1548=>"Jabneh stands two |parsae|" (that is, eight miles) "from |Azotus|: and was at last called |Ivelyn|."
lightfoot_ch1549=>They are the words of Benjamin, in his Itinerary [p.51].

lightfoot_ch1600=>"Lydda was a village, not yielding to a city in greatness."
lightfoot_ch1601=>Concerning its situation, and distance from Jerusalem, the Misna hath these words:
lightfoot_ch1602=>"The vineyard of four years" (that is, the fruit of a vineyard now of four years' growth;
lightfoot_ch1603=>for, for the first three years, they were trees, as it were, not circumcised) "was brought to Jerusalem,
lightfoot_ch1604=>in the space of a day's journey on every side. Now these were the bounds of it; Elath on the south;
lightfoot_ch1605=>Acrabatta on the north; Lydda on the west; and Jordan on the east." The Gloss;
lightfoot_ch1606=>"The wise men appointed, that the second tenth of the fruits, growing within the space of a day's journey from Jerusalem,
lightfoot_ch1607=>should be carried thither to be eaten, and should not be redeemed.
lightfoot_ch1608=>That the streets of Jerusalem might be crowned with fruits."
lightfoot_ch1609=>When you consider this distance, you may well wonder what that means, which is almost become a proverb,
lightfoot_ch1610=>"The women of Lydda knead their dough, go up to the Temple, pray, and come back, before it be leavened."
lightfoot_ch1611=>Not that the distance of the places is made less; but that hence may be shewn, that no disadvantage accrued to these women,
lightfoot_ch1612=>who paid their vows and performed their religion.
lightfoot_ch1613=>I very much wonder, that the authors of the maps have held Lod and Lydda for two towns;
lightfoot_ch1614=>Lod not far from Jordan and Jericho; Lydda not far from the Mediterranean sea.
lightfoot_ch1615=>A Jew, or one versed in Jewish affairs, will laugh at these things; when Lod and Lydda have no difference at all between them,
lightfoot_ch1616=>-- unless that that is Hebrew, -- this, Greek.
lightfoot_ch1617=>When the Sanhedrim sat in Jabneh, there flourished eminent schools in Lydda.
lightfoot_ch1618=>Yea, Lydda had her schools and her learned men, when the university was gone away into Galilee, and Jabneh lamented her loss of scholars.
lightfoot_ch1619=>There R. Akibah bore the headship of the school, removed, as I said before, from his government by Rabban Gamaliel,
lightfoot_ch1620=>"because he detained at Lydda more than forty pair of men travelling" (towards Jabneh)
lightfoot_ch1621=>"to give their testimony to the Sanhedrim concerning the new moon; and suffered them not to go forwards."
lightfoot_ch1622=>Gamaliel being dead, or rather removed, -- when R. Akibah was head in Jabneh,
lightfoot_ch1623=>R. Tarphon was rector of the school of Lydda, whom you have sometimes disputing with R. Akibah,
lightfoot_ch1624=>but at last yielding to him with this commendation;
lightfoot_ch1625=>"He that separates himself from you, is as if he separated himself from his own life."
lightfoot_ch1626=>We read of five elders teaching and erring before Tarphon at Lydda.
lightfoot_ch1627=>We read also of a fast enjoined at Lydda for the obtaining of rain, and Tarphon the moderator of the solemnity.
lightfoot_ch1628=>The stories of this place are infinite; we will gather a few.
lightfoot_ch1629=>Helena the queen celebrated the feast of tabernacles at Lydda.
lightfoot_ch1630=>R. Eliezar and R. Joshua were sometime present in the same place at the feast of dedication:
lightfoot_ch1631=>but being not enough satisfied concerning the fast at that time enjoined, one went to the bath, -- the other, to the barber's shop.
lightfoot_ch1632=>Here it was, that Ben Satdah was surprised and taken, and brought before the Sanhedrim, and stoned...
lightfoot_ch1633=>Since it was not lawful to intercalate the year any where but in Judea,
lightfoot_ch1634=>"a great many went to Lydda out of the school of the Rabbi" (Judah Haccodesh, viz. out of Galilee.
lightfoot_ch1635=>And a little after: "R. Jeremiah asked before R. Zeira, Is not Lydda a part of Judea? Yes, saith he.
lightfoot_ch1636=>Wherefore, then, do they not transact the intercalation of the year there? -- Because they are obstinate, and unskillful in the law."
lightfoot_ch1637=>"Lydda is a part of Judea." Let some maps mark this, which have placed a certain Lod,
lightfoot_ch1638=>which never was any where, not far from Jericho, as was said before; because Lod, in the land of Benjamin,
lightfoot_ch1639=>is brought in, Nehemiah 11:35: but they set Lydda far beyond the bounds of Judea in the land of Ephraim.
lightfoot_ch1640=>"Koshab Bar Ulla sometime got away to Lydda to Rabbi Josua Ben Levi, dwelling there, when he fled from the Romans.
lightfoot_ch1641=>The Romans pursued him, and besieged the city. Unless you deliver him to us, say they,
lightfoot_ch1642=>we will destroy the city. R. Josua Ben Levi persuaded him, and he was delivered to the Romans."
lightfoot_ch1643=>I might produce numberless things celebrating the name of Lydda; such as,
lightfoot_ch1644=>"The chamber of Beth-Arum in Lydda." "The chamber of Beth-lebaza in Lydda."
lightfoot_ch1645=>"The chamber of Beth-Nethaza in Lydda." -- We suppose these were schools.
lightfoot_ch1646=>I might mention very many names of Rabbins residing at Lydda, besides those whom I have remembered before:
lightfoot_ch1647=>such are, R. Chama Bar Chanina, and R. Hoshaia with him. R. Illai, and R. Eliezer;
lightfoot_ch1648=>and others, who are vulgarly called the Southern, in the sense we produced before.
lightfoot_ch1649=>Concerning R. Josua Ben Levi, by name, the author of Juchasin hath these words,
lightfoot_ch1650=>"His habitation, or college, was in the south of the land of Israel." He means Lydda.
lightfoot_ch1651=>R. Eliezer, dying at Caesarea, desired to be buried at Lydda, whom R. Akibah bewailed as well with blood as tears.
lightfoot_ch1652=>"For when he met his hearse betwixt Caesarea and Lydda, he beat himself in that manner, that blood flowed down upon the earth.
lightfoot_ch1653=>Lamenting, thus he spoke, -- O my father, my father, the chariot and horsemen of Israel.
lightfoot_ch1654=>I have much money, but I want a moneyer, to change it." The Gloss is this, "I have very many questions;
lightfoot_ch1655=>but now there is no man, to whom I may propound them."
lightfoot_ch1656=>There is a pla5ce between Jamnia and Lydda, which was called Bekiin; of which there is this mention:
lightfoot_ch1657=>"R. Jochanan Ben Brucha, and R. Eliezer the blind, travelling from Jabneh to Lydda, met R. Josua in Bekiin," &c.
lightfoot_ch1658=>From Jamnia to Joppe (according to Benjamin, in his Itinerary [p.51]) are three leagues, or parsae:
lightfoot_ch1659=>"Now Lydda was nigh to Joppa," Acts 9:38.
